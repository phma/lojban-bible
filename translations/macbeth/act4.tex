% SCENE I. A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron.

%      Thunder. Enter the three Witches

% First Witch

%      Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.

% Second Witch

%      Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.

% Third Witch

%      Harpier cries 'Tis time, 'tis time.

% First Witch

%      Round about the cauldron go;
%      In the poison'd entrails throw.
%      Toad, that under cold stone
%      Days and nights has thirty-one
%      Swelter'd venom sleeping got,
%      Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.

% ALL

%      Double, double toil and trouble;
%      Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

% Second Witch

%      Fillet of a fenny snake,
%      In the cauldron boil and bake;
%      Eye of newt and toe of frog,
%      Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
%      Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
%      Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,
%      For a charm of powerful trouble,
%      Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.

% ALL

%      Double, double toil and trouble;
%      Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

% Third Witch

%      Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
%      Witches' mummy, maw and gulf
%      Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,
%      Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,
%      Liver of blaspheming Jew,
%      Gall of goat, and slips of yew
%      Silver'd in the moon's eclipse,
%      Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,
%      Finger of birth-strangled babe
%      Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,
%      Make the gruel thick and slab:
%      Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,
%      For the ingredients of our cauldron.

% ALL

%      Double, double toil and trouble;
%      Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

% Second Witch

%      Cool it with a baboon's blood,
%      Then the charm is firm and good.

%      Enter HECATE to the other three Witches

% HECATE

%      O well done! I commend your pains;
%      And every one shall share i' the gains;
%      And now about the cauldron sing,
%      Live elves and fairies in a ring,
%      Enchanting all that you put in.

%      Music and a song: 'Black spirits,' & c

%      HECATE retires

% Second Witch

%      By the pricking of my thumbs,
%      Something wicked this way comes.
%      Open, locks,
%      Whoever knocks!

%      Enter MACBETH

% MACBETH

%      How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
%      What is't you do?

% ALL

%      A deed without a name.

% MACBETH

%      I conjure you, by that which you profess,
%      Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:
%      Though you untie the winds and let them fight
%      Against the churches; though the yesty waves
%      Confound and swallow navigation up;
%      Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;
%      Though castles topple on their warders' heads;
%      Though palaces and pyramids do slope
%      Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
%      Of nature's germens tumble all together,
%      Even till destruction sicken; answer me
%      To what I ask you.

% First Witch

%      Speak.

% Second Witch

%      Demand.

% Third Witch

%      We'll answer.

% First Witch

%      Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,
%      Or from our masters?

% MACBETH

%      Call 'em; let me see 'em.

% First Witch

%      Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten
%      Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten
%      From the murderer's gibbet throw
%      Into the flame.

% ALL

%      Come, high or low;
%      Thyself and office deftly show!

%      Thunder. First Apparition: an armed Head

% MACBETH

%      Tell me, thou unknown power,--

% First Witch

%      He knows thy thought:
%      Hear his speech, but say thou nought.

% First Apparition

%      Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;
%      Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.

%      Descends

% MACBETH

%      Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
%      Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one
%      word more,--

% First Witch

%      He will not be commanded: here's another,
%      More potent than the first.

%      Thunder. Second Apparition: A bloody Child

% Second Apparition

%      Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!

% MACBETH

%      Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.

% Second Apparition

%      Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn
%      The power of man, for none of woman born
%      Shall harm Macbeth.

%      Descends

% MACBETH

%      Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?
%      But yet I'll make assurance double sure,
%      And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;
%      That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
%      And sleep in spite of thunder.

%      Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned, with a tree in his
%      hand

%      What is this
%      That rises like the issue of a king,
%      And wears upon his baby-brow the round
%      And top of sovereignty?

% ALL

%      Listen, but speak not to't.

% Third Apparition

%      Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care
%      Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:
%      Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until
%      Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
%      Shall come against him.

%      Descends

% MACBETH

%      That will never be
%      Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
%      Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!
%      Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
%      Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth
%      Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
%      To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart
%      Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
%      Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever
%      Reign in this kingdom?

% ALL

%      Seek to know no more.

% MACBETH

%      I will be satisfied: deny me this,
%      And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
%      Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?

%      Hautboys

% First Witch

%      Show!

% Second Witch

%      Show!

% Third Witch

%      Show!

% ALL

%      Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
%      Come like shadows, so depart!

%      A show of Eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand; GHOST OF
%      BANQUO following

% MACBETH

%      Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!
%      Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,
%      Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
%      A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
%      Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!
%      What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
%      Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:
%      And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
%      Which shows me many more; and some I see
%      That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:
%      Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true;
%      For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,
%      And points at them for his.

%      Apparitions vanish

%      What, is this so?

% First Witch

%      Ay, sir, all this is so: but why
%      Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
%      Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
%      And show the best of our delights:
%      I'll charm the air to give a sound,
%      While you perform your antic round:
%      That this great king may kindly say,
%      Our duties did his welcome pay.

%      Music. The witches dance and then vanish, with HECATE

% MACBETH

%      Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
%      Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
%      Come in, without there!

%      Enter LENNOX

% LENNOX

%      What's your grace's will?

% MACBETH

%      Saw you the weird sisters?

% LENNOX

%      No, my lord.

% MACBETH

%      Came they not by you?

% LENNOX

%      No, indeed, my lord.

% MACBETH

%      Infected be the air whereon they ride;
%      And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
%      The galloping of horse: who was't came by?

% LENNOX

%      'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
%      Macduff is fled to England.

% MACBETH

%      Fled to England!

% LENNOX

%      Ay, my good lord.

% MACBETH

%      Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:
%      The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
%      Unless the deed go with it; from this moment
%      The very firstlings of my heart shall be
%      The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
%      To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:
%      The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
%      Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword
%      His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
%      That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
%      This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
%      But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?
%      Come, bring me where they are.

%      Exeunt

% SCENE II. Fife. Macduff's castle.

%      Enter LADY MACDUFF, her Son, and ROSS

% LADY MACDUFF

%      What had he done, to make him fly the land?

% ROSS

%      You must have patience, madam.

% LADY MACDUFF

%      He had none:
%      His flight was madness: when our actions do not,
%      Our fears do make us traitors.

% ROSS

%      You know not
%      Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.

% LADY MACDUFF

%      Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,
%      His mansion and his titles in a place
%      From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
%      He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,
%      The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
%      Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
%      All is the fear and nothing is the love;
%      As little is the wisdom, where the flight
%      So runs against all reason.

% ROSS

%      My dearest coz,
%      I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,
%      He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
%      The fits o' the season. I dare not speak
%      much further;
%      But cruel are the times, when we are traitors
%      And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour
%      From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
%      But float upon a wild and violent sea
%      Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
%      Shall not be long but I'll be here again:
%      Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward
%      To what they were before. My pretty cousin,
%      Blessing upon you!

% LADY MACDUFF

%      Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.

% ROSS

%      I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
%      It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:
%      I take my leave at once.

%      Exit

% LADY MACDUFF

%      Sirrah, your father's dead;
%      And what will you do now? How will you live?

% Son

%      As birds do, mother.

% LADY MACDUFF

%      What, with worms and flies?

% Son

%      With what I get, I mean; and so do they.

% LADY MACDUFF

%      Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
%      The pitfall nor the gin.

% Son

%      Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.
%      My father is not dead, for all your saying.

% LADY MACDUFF

%      Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?

% Son

%      Nay, how will you do for a husband?

% LADY MACDUFF

%      Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.

% Son

%      Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.

% LADY MACDUFF

%      Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,
%      With wit enough for thee.

% Son

%      Was my father a traitor, mother?

% LADY MACDUFF

%      Ay, that he was.

% Son

%      What is a traitor?

% LADY MACDUFF

%      Why, one that swears and lies.

% Son

%      And be all traitors that do so?

% LADY MACDUFF

%      Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.

% Son

%      And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?

% LADY MACDUFF

%      Every one.

% Son

%      Who must hang them?

% LADY MACDUFF

%      Why, the honest men.

% Son

%      Then the liars and swearers are fools,
%      for there are liars and swearers enow to beat
%      the honest men and hang up them.

% LADY MACDUFF

%      Now, God help thee, poor monkey!
%      But how wilt thou do for a father?

% Son

%      If he were dead, you'ld weep for
%      him: if you would not, it were a good sign
%      that I should quickly have a new father.

% LADY MACDUFF

%      Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!

%      Enter a Messenger

% Messenger

%      Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
%      Though in your state of honour I am perfect.
%      I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:
%      If you will take a homely man's advice,
%      Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
%      To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;
%      To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
%      Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!
%      I dare abide no longer.

%      Exit

% LADY MACDUFF

%      Whither should I fly?
%      I have done no harm. But I remember now
%      I am in this earthly world; where to do harm
%      Is often laudable, to do good sometime
%      Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,
%      Do I put up that womanly defence,
%      To say I have done no harm?

%      Enter Murderers

%      What are these faces?

% First Murderer

%      Where is your husband?

% LADY MACDUFF

%      I hope, in no place so unsanctified
%      Where such as thou mayst find him.

% First Murderer

%      He's a traitor.

% Son

%      Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!

% First Murderer

%      What, you egg!

%      Stabbing him

%      Young fry of treachery!

% Son

%      He has kill'd me, mother:
%      Run away, I pray you!

%      Dies

%      Exit LADY MACDUFF, crying 'Murder!' Exeunt Murderers, following
%      her

% SCENE III. England. Before the King's palace.

%      Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF

% MALCOLM

%      Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there
%      Weep our sad bosoms empty.

% MACDUFF

%      Let us rather
%      Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men
%      Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn
%      New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
%      Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
%      As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out
%      Like syllable of dolour.

% MALCOLM

%      What I believe I'll wail,
%      What know believe, and what I can redress,
%      As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
%      What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
%      This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
%      Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.
%      He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;
%      but something
%      You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom
%      To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
%      To appease an angry god.

% MACDUFF

%      I am not treacherous.

% MALCOLM

%      But Macbeth is.
%      A good and virtuous nature may recoil
%      In an imperial charge. But I shall crave
%      your pardon;
%      That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:
%      Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;
%      Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
%      Yet grace must still look so.

% MACDUFF

%      I have lost my hopes.

% MALCOLM

%      Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
%      Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
%      Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
%      Without leave-taking? I pray you,
%      Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,
%      But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,
%      Whatever I shall think.

% MACDUFF

%      Bleed, bleed, poor country!
%      Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,
%      For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou
%      thy wrongs;
%      The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:
%      I would not be the villain that thou think'st
%      For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,
%      And the rich East to boot.

% MALCOLM

%      Be not offended:
%      I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
%      I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
%      It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash
%      Is added to her wounds: I think withal
%      There would be hands uplifted in my right;
%      And here from gracious England have I offer
%      Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
%      When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,
%      Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
%      Shall have more vices than it had before,
%      More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,
%      By him that shall succeed.

% MACDUFF

%      What should he be?

% MALCOLM

%      It is myself I mean: in whom I know
%      All the particulars of vice so grafted
%      That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
%      Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
%      Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
%      With my confineless harms.

% MACDUFF

%      Not in the legions
%      Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
%      In evils to top Macbeth.

% MALCOLM

%      I grant him bloody,
%      Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
%      Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
%      That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,
%      In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
%      Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up
%      The cistern of my lust, and my desire
%      All continent impediments would o'erbear
%      That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
%      Than such an one to reign.

% MACDUFF

%      Boundless intemperance
%      In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
%      The untimely emptying of the happy throne
%      And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
%      To take upon you what is yours: you may
%      Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
%      And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
%      We have willing dames enough: there cannot be
%      That vulture in you, to devour so many
%      As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
%      Finding it so inclined.

% MALCOLM

%      With this there grows
%      In my most ill-composed affection such
%      A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
%      I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
%      Desire his jewels and this other's house:
%      And my more-having would be as a sauce
%      To make me hunger more; that I should forge
%      Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
%      Destroying them for wealth.

% MACDUFF

%      This avarice
%      Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
%      Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
%      The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
%      Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.
%      Of your mere own: all these are portable,
%      With other graces weigh'd.

% MALCOLM

%      But I have none: the king-becoming graces,
%      As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,
%      Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
%      Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
%      I have no relish of them, but abound
%      In the division of each several crime,
%      Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
%      Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
%      Uproar the universal peace, confound
%      All unity on earth.

% MACDUFF

%      O Scotland, Scotland!

% MALCOLM

%      If such a one be fit to govern, speak:
%      I am as I have spoken.

% MACDUFF

%      Fit to govern!
%      No, not to live. O nation miserable,
%      With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,
%      When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
%      Since that the truest issue of thy throne
%      By his own interdiction stands accursed,
%      And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
%      Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,
%      Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,
%      Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
%      These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
%      Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,
%      Thy hope ends here!

% MALCOLM

%      Macduff, this noble passion,
%      Child of integrity, hath from my soul
%      Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
%      To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
%      By many of these trains hath sought to win me
%      Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
%      From over-credulous haste: but God above
%      Deal between thee and me! for even now
%      I put myself to thy direction, and
%      Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
%      The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
%      For strangers to my nature. I am yet
%      Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
%      Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
%      At no time broke my faith, would not betray
%      The devil to his fellow and delight
%      No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
%      Was this upon myself: what I am truly,
%      Is thine and my poor country's to command:
%      Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
%      Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
%      Already at a point, was setting forth.
%      Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness
%      Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?

% MACDUFF

%      Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
%      'Tis hard to reconcile.

%      Enter a Doctor

% MALCOLM

%      Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray you?

% Doctor

%      Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls
%      That stay his cure: their malady convinces
%      The great assay of art; but at his touch--
%      Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--
%      They presently amend.

% MALCOLM

%      I thank you, doctor.

%      Exit Doctor

% MACDUFF

%      What's the disease he means?

% MALCOLM

%      'Tis call'd the evil:
%      A most miraculous work in this good king;
%      Which often, since my here-remain in England,
%      I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
%      Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,
%      All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
%      The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
%      Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
%      Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,
%      To the succeeding royalty he leaves
%      The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,
%      He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
%      And sundry blessings hang about his throne,
%      That speak him full of grace.

%      Enter ROSS

% MACDUFF

%      See, who comes here?

% MALCOLM

%      My countryman; but yet I know him not.

% MACDUFF

%      My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.

% MALCOLM

%      I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
%      The means that makes us strangers!

% ROSS

%      Sir, amen.

% MACDUFF

%      Stands Scotland where it did?

% ROSS

%      Alas, poor country!
%      Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
%      Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,
%      But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
%      Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
%      Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems
%      A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell
%      Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives
%      Expire before the flowers in their caps,
%      Dying or ere they sicken.

% MACDUFF

%      O, relation
%      Too nice, and yet too true!

% MALCOLM

%      What's the newest grief?

% ROSS

%      That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:
%      Each minute teems a new one.

% MACDUFF

%      How does my wife?

% ROSS

%      Why, well.

% MACDUFF

%      And all my children?

% ROSS

%      Well too.

% MACDUFF

%      The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?

% ROSS

%      No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.

% MACDUFF

%      But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?

% ROSS

%      When I came hither to transport the tidings,
%      Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour
%      Of many worthy fellows that were out;
%      Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,
%      For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:
%      Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland
%      Would create soldiers, make our women fight,
%      To doff their dire distresses.

% MALCOLM

%      Be't their comfort
%      We are coming thither: gracious England hath
%      Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
%      An older and a better soldier none
%      That Christendom gives out.

% ROSS

%      Would I could answer
%      This comfort with the like! But I have words
%      That would be howl'd out in the desert air,
%      Where hearing should not latch them.

% MACDUFF

%      What concern they?
%      The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
%      Due to some single breast?

% ROSS

%      No mind that's honest
%      But in it shares some woe; though the main part
%      Pertains to you alone.

% MACDUFF

%      If it be mine,
%      Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.

% ROSS

%      Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,
%      Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
%      That ever yet they heard.

% MACDUFF

%      Hum! I guess at it.

% ROSS

%      Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes
%      Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,
%      Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,
%      To add the death of you.

% MALCOLM

%      Merciful heaven!
%      What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;
%      Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak
%      Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.

% MACDUFF

%      My children too?

% ROSS

%      Wife, children, servants, all
%      That could be found.

% MACDUFF

%      And I must be from thence!
%      My wife kill'd too?

% ROSS

%      I have said.

% MALCOLM

%      Be comforted:
%      Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,
%      To cure this deadly grief.

% MACDUFF

%      He has no children. All my pretty ones?
%      Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
%      What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
%      At one fell swoop?

% MALCOLM

%      Dispute it like a man.

% MACDUFF

%      I shall do so;
%      But I must also feel it as a man:
%      I cannot but remember such things were,
%      That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,
%      And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
%      They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,
%      Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
%      Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!

% MALCOLM

%      Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
%      Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.

% MACDUFF

%      O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
%      And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,
%      Cut short all intermission; front to front
%      Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
%      Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,
%      Heaven forgive him too!

% MALCOLM

%      This tune goes manly.
%      Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;
%      Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth
%      Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
%      Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:
%      The night is long that never finds the day.

%      Exeunt
