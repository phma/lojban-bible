<chapter id="less4"><title>Numbers, and a few more articles</title><para>One of the first things you learn in a new language is how to count,and this course is no exception. However, in Lojban, numbers include muchmore than just counting; for example, in Lojban,<wordasword>some</wordasword>, <wordasword>most</wordasword> and<wordasword>too many</wordasword> are numbers. </para><sect1 id="less4numbers"><title>Basic numbers</title><para>The numbers from one to nine are as follows:<orderedlist><listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">pa</foreignphrase></para></listitem><listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">re</foreignphrase></para></listitem><listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ci</foreignphrase></para></listitem><listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">vo</foreignphrase></para></listitem><listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mu</foreignphrase></para></listitem><listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">xa</foreignphrase></para></listitem><listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ze</foreignphrase></para></listitem><listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">bi</foreignphrase></para></listitem><listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">so</foreignphrase></para></listitem></orderedlist>This leaves zero, which is <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">no</foreignphrase> (think <quote>yes, we have nobananas</quote>). You may have noticed that the numbers repeat the vowels<wordasword>AEIOU</wordasword>. Since you can't get by without memorisingnumbers, try to think of mnemonics for the unfamiliar ones. For example,although the sound is different, <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">xa</foreignphrase> has the <wordasword>X</wordasword> of<quote role="gloss">six</quote>, and I remembered <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">so</foreignphrase> by thinking of the proverb <quote>Astitch in time saves <emphasis>nine</emphasis>,</quote> which is about<emphasis>sew</emphasis>ing (<foreignphraselang="art-lojban">.oi</foreignphrase>). </para><para>Numbers from 10 onwards are made by putting the digits together,just like you'd say a telephone number.  For example:<variablelist><varlistentry><term><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">pano</foreignphrase></term> <listitem><para>10</para></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">zebi</foreignphrase></term> <listitem><para>78</para></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">xanoci</foreignphrase></term> <listitem><para>603</para></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">vomusore</foreignphrase></term> <listitem><para>4,592</para></listitem></varlistentry></variablelist>4,592 has a comma in it (or a full stop in some languages, just to makethings confusing). We can't use a comma in Lojban, because that means<quote>separate these two syllables</quote> (as we saw in <linklinkend="less1">Lesson 1</link> with Lojbanised names like <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">zo,is.</foreignphrase> for <wordasword>Zoe</wordasword>).What we say instead is <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">ki'o</foreignphrase>. We don't <emphasis>have</emphasis>to use <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ki'o</foreignphrase>, but it canmake things clearer. So 4,592 can also be read as <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">vo ki'o musore</foreignphrase>. <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">ki'o</foreignphrase> also has the advantage that if thefollowing digits are all zeroes, we don't need to say them, so 3,000 is<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ci ki'o</foreignphrase>. You can remember<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ki'o</foreignphrase> easily if you thinkof <wordasword>kilo</wordasword> &mdash; a thousand. </para><para>Just as we have a word for a comma, we also have one for a decimalpoint: <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">pi</foreignphrase>. So 5.3 is <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">mupici</foreignphrase>.  In fact, <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">pi</foreignphrase> is not always decimal; it's the point forwhatever number base you're using. But that's a more advanced topic. </para><tip><para>Don't get this mixedup with the number <wordasword>pi</wordasword>: 3.1415..., which has its own word in Lojban: <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">pai</foreignphrase> &mdash; oddly enough.</para></tip><para>When you want to talk about numbers as <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> &mdash; that is to say, as things in and of themselves &mdash; you need to put an article in front of them. But that article cannot be <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la</foreignphrase>, and for reasons which hopefully will become clear soon, it cannot be <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le</foreignphrase> either. In front of numbers, Lojban uses the article <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">li</foreignphrase>. So <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">li pareci</foreignphrase> means <quote role="gloss">the number one hundred and twenty three</quote>. <quote role="gloss">One, two, three</quote>, on the other hand, would be <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">li pa li re li ci</foreignphrase>: each <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">li</foreignphrase> introduces a brand new number.</para><simplesect role="exercise"><title>Exercise 1</title> <para>What are thefollowing numbers in Lojban?

So <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">li bi</foreignphrase> is <quote role="gloss">the numbereight.</quote> Actually, outside mathematics, <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">li</foreignphrase> is not used very much. What we usuallywant to say is things like <quote role="gloss">three people,</quote> or<quote role="gloss">the two women.</quote> </para><note><title>Note for mathematicians</title><para>Lojban has a number ofwords to deal with basic mathematics, and also an incredible number ofwords to deal with just about any mathematical expression you can think ofin a separate subset of the language (<citetitle>The Complete Lojban Language</citetitle>, Chapter 18.) But you can't expect everything in abeginners' course. </para></note><para>We can use numbers either before or after <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">le</foreignphrase>.  For example,<informalexample><literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ci le gerku</foreignphrase></literallayout></informalexample>means <quote role="gloss">three of the dogs</quote>, while<informalexample><literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le ci gerku</foreignphrase></literallayout></informalexample>means <quote role="gloss">the three dogs.</quote></para><para>What do we do, though, if we just want to say <quote>threedogs</quote>? For this we need another article, <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">lo</foreignphrase>. The logic of <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">lo</foreignphrase> is pretty complicated, but itbasically means <quote role="gloss">something which really is,</quote>which nine times out of ten is the same as English<wordasword>a</wordasword> or <wordasword>some</wordasword> (translatingLojban grammar into English like this is a mortal sin, but even so, this isthe best thing to do with <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">lo</foreignphrase> at this stage!). </para><note><title>Note for logicians</title><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">loprenu cu klama</foreignphrase> expresses the proposition <quote>There exists atleast one person, such that that person goes.</quote>  </para><para>By contrast, <wordasword>the</wordasword> cannot mean the same thingas <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lo</foreignphrase>. In English,<wordasword>the dog</wordasword> doesn't mean just <quoterole="gloss">something which really is a dog</quote>, but more like <quoterole="gloss">something which really is a dog, <emphasis>and which I alreadyhave in mind.</emphasis></quote> (That's how <quote>A dog came in.<emphasis>A</emphasis> dog was black</quote> and <quote>A dog came in.<emphasis>The</emphasis> dog was black</quote> are different.) Lojbansidesteps this problem by using <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">legerku</foreignphrase> <quote role="gloss">something which I'm going to calla dog</quote>. It's up to the audience to put together what the speaker hadin mind when s/he called it <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">legerku</foreignphrase>, just as it is the audience's job in English to workout what dog the speaker had in mind.</para> </note><para>So <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ci lo gerku</foreignphrase> means<quote role="gloss">three of those which really are dogs</quote>, or inplain words, <quote role="gloss">three dogs</quote>. <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">lo ci gerku</foreignphrase>, however, means that thereare only three dogs in the world, which is not something you'd really wantto say. (Mathematicians and logicians can look up the relevant parts of<wordasword>The Complete Lojban Language</wordasword> if they wantclarification on this issue &mdash; or for that matter on the differencesbetween <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lo</foreignphrase> and<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le</foreignphrase>). </para><para>Let us now consider the English sentence <quote>Three men carried a piano</quote>. This sentence has two potential meanings, as does any sentence involving a plural in Lojban. You could be saying that the sentence holds true for each individual of the group. If the men involved are Andy, Barry, and Chris, you might be saying that Andy carried the piano, and Barry carried the piano, and Chris carried the piano. Alternatively, you could be saying that the sentence holds for the group <emphasis>as a unit</emphasis>: noone carried the piano individually, but all three men carried it together.</para><para>Natural languages typically leave it to context and plausibility todetermine which of the two interpretations holds. But Lojban is a logicallanguage, and so does not tolerate this confusion! <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">le</foreignphrase> and <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">lo</foreignphrase> force the individual interpretation.That is, if I say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ci lo nanmu cu bevri lepipno</foreignphrase>, I mean that each of the three men (<foreignphraselang="art-lojban">nanmu</foreignphrase>) carried (<foreignphraselang="art-lojban">bevri</foreignphrase>) the piano (<foreignphraselang="art-lojban">pipno</foreignphrase>). And if I say <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">ci lo gerku cu batci mi</foreignphrase>, I just mean thatthree dogs bite me. Maybe one dog bit me in the morning, one in theafternoon, and one at night, or maybe I mean that I have been bitten by adog three times in my life. There is nothing to say that the three dogshave anything to do with each other.</para><para>But if you want those dogs, or those men, to be considered as a unit,you'd say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis>lu'o</emphasis> ci lonanmu cu bevri le pipno</foreignphrase>, and <foreignphraselang="art-lojban"><emphasis>lu'o</emphasis> ci lo gerku cu batcimi</foreignphrase>. <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lu'o</foreignphrase>means <quote role="gloss">the mass composed of</quote>, and in effectconverts a bunch of individuals into a coherent unit. In the case of thedogs, for example, it makes them a pack. If you're a fan of computerstrategy games, think of <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">lu'o</foreignphrase> as like the <quoterole="socalled">group</quote> command for units (there's also an <quoterole="socalled">ungroup</quote> command, <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">lu'a</foreignphrase>). Moreover, since the dogs act as apack, it is not necessarily true that each of them individually bit you: itis actually enough that one of them bit you, for the pack to have bittenyou.</para><para>With <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le</foreignphrase> things aresimpler. While <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le panoninmu</foreignphrase> means <quote role="gloss">the ten women</quote>,<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lu'o le pano ninmu</foreignphrase> means<quote role="gloss">the ten women treated as a group or mass</quote>. Let'simagine that ten women I have in mind kiss me on ten separate occasions.(Hey, I do get to write these lessons for my own amusement, after all...) I could then say<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le pano ninmu cu cinba mi</foreignphrase>,in which case I'd consider myself quite fortunate. However, if I say<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis>lu'o</emphasis> le pano panoninmu cu cinba mi</foreignphrase>, I mean that the ten women kiss me<foreignphrase lang="fra">en masse</foreignphrase>, in which case I wouldconsider myself either blessed or harrassed (maybe I'm a rock star orsomething.) It does not necessarily mean that each and every womankisses me; simply that I was mobbed by a group of ten women and kissed byone or (probably) more in the process. </para><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lu'o le</foreignphrase> and <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">lu'o lo</foreignphrase> are very useful concepts, even without explicit numbers,and there are shorter ways of saying each when no number comes between them:<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lei</foreignphrase>and <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">loi</foreignphrase>.  So the three mencarrying the piano could be expressed as <foreignphraselang="art-lojban"><emphasis>loi</emphasis> nanmu cu bevri lepipno</foreignphrase>, and the throng of women kissing me (!)  as<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis>lei</emphasis> pano ninmu cu cinbami</foreignphrase>. </para><simplesect role="exercise"><title>Exercise 2</title><para>In the following English sentences, are the emphasised nouns individuals (prefixed in Lojban with <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le</foreignphrase> or <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lo</foreignphrase>) or masses (prefixed in Lojban with <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lei</foreignphrase> or <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">loi</foreignphrase>)?<orderedlist><listitem><para><emphasis>The students</emphasis> listened to the radio.</para></listitem><listitem><para><emphasis>The students</emphasis> built a radio.</para></listitem><listitem><para>I bought <emphasis>sugar</emphasis>.</para></listitem><listitem><para>I bought <emphasis>radios</emphasis>.</para></listitem><listitem><para><emphasis>Elephants</emphasis> live to an old age.</para></listitem><listitem><para><emphasis>Elephants</emphasis> have flat ears.</para></listitem><listitem><para><emphasis>The students</emphasis> liked talking about elephants.</para></listitem></orderedlist></para></simplesect></sect1><sect1 id="less4proportions"><title>Proportions</title> <warning><para>This section gets intoeven more tricky logical stuff.

If, however, we use<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lo</foreignphrase>, the meaning changes.We can't say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">re lo ciprenu</foreignphrase> to mean two out of <emphasis>any</emphasis> threepeople (i.e. two thirds of the population). This is because while<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le ci prenu</foreignphrase> means thethree people that I have in mind, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lo ciprenu</foreignphrase>, by the same logic, means the three people thatactually exist &mdash; i.e. that there are only three people in theuniverse. (That's also why, as the astute reader may have noted, you can'tsay <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">loi <emphasis>ci</emphasis> nanmu cubevri le pipno</foreignphrase>.) You would therefore only use thenumber+<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lo</foreignphrase>+number formulaif you knew the actual numbers rather than just the proportions, e.g.<informalexample><literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">re lo mi ci mensi cu nelci la rikis.martin.</foreignphrase>Two of my three sisters like Ricky Martin.</literallayout></informalexample></para><para>This states two facts. First, that I have three sisters (though it isnot actually true in my case!) Second, that two of them like Ricky Martin(it doesn't actually state that my third sister <emphasis>hates</emphasis>him &mdash; she may be indifferent to him, or never have heard of him). IfI use <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le</foreignphrase> in the samesentence, it isn't actually wrong, but it allows the possibility that Ihave, say, five sisters, but I'm only talking about three of them! This isone of the few areas where <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">le</foreignphrase> and <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">lo</foreignphrase> are <emphasis>not</emphasis> like<wordasword>the</wordasword> and <wordasword>a/some</wordasword>. </para><para>But with people, I would have to say something on the order of<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">vo ki'o nocize ki'o pasovo lo xa ki'ocipare ki'o pamubi remna cu nelci la rikis.martin.</foreignphrase> &mdash;I would have to give the real counts for all humans, and for all humans whosuffer from that particular affliction. Which obviously is not terriblypractical. (The real counts, I mean, not the affliction. Though on secondthought...)</para><para>One way out of this is to use <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">fi'u</foreignphrase>, which is like the Lojban slash sign.  So<quote>two out of every three people</quote> is really <quote>2/3 of people</quote>, or<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">refi'uci loi prenu</foreignphrase>. Of course, this is actually a fraction, and fractions have decimal equivalents; you could also say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis>pixaxaxa</emphasis> loi prenu</foreignphrase>, and not be that far off &mdash; even if your use of decimals might have some people laughing in the aisles... </para><para>Yes, that's our new friend <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">loi</foreignphrase> in that sentence. If I had said<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">refi'uci lo prenu</foreignphrase>, thatwould have to be understood in the same way as <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">re lo prenu</foreignphrase> or <foreignphraselang="art-lojban">ci lo prenu</foreignphrase> (i.e. as a count of individuals), and I would have ended uptalking about two thirds of a person. In most cultures, chopping up personsinto thirds is not considered acceptable behaviour even for pollsters oradvertisers. On the other hand, chopping up<emphasis>populations</emphasis> into thirds is perfectly acceptable; andthat's what <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">loi prenu</foreignphrase>is.</para> </sect1><sect1 id="less4quantities"><title>Quantities</title><para>I've said thatwords like <wordasword>most</wordasword> and <wordasword>many</wordasword>are numbers in Lojban, which is pretty logical if you think about it.
