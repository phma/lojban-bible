<chapter id="less15"><title>Singled out: Isolating specific places</title><titleabbrev>Singled out</titleabbrev>

<para>In this lesson, we look at three features of Lojban grammar which
normally get relegated to the <quote role="socalled">too-hard</quote>
basket. Each of them involves singling out a particular <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> from a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase>, as being somehow more special than
the other <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>. The full 
logical machinery associated with these <quote role="socalled">singlings 
out</quote> can get rather formidable, which is why Lojbanists tend to 
regard these features with some degree of awe. Hopefully we'll present 
these concepts to you with a minimum of fuss, in enough detail that you can go about using 
them comfortably in your Lojban.</para>

<sect1 id="less15kau"><title>Indirect questions</title>

<para>A Lojban question word is a request to <quote>fill in the
slot</quote>, <emphasis>wherever</emphasis> it appears in a sentence. So

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis>ma</emphasis> cilre la
lojban.</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>is the question <quote><emphasis>Who</emphasis> is
learning Lojban?</quote> By the same token, 

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mi djica lenu <emphasis>ma</emphasis> cilre la
lojban.</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>is the question <quote>I want
<emphasis>who</emphasis> to learn Lojban?</quote> &mdash; or, in actual
English (since English likes to have its question words at the start of the
sentence), <quote><emphasis>Who</emphasis> do I want to learn
Lojban?</quote> And 

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mi pu cusku lesedu'u <emphasis>ma</emphasis> cilre la
lojban.</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>is <quote>I said <emphasis>who</emphasis> is 
learning Lojban?</quote> &mdash; i.e. <quote><emphasis>Who</emphasis> did 
I say is learning Lojban?</quote></para>

<para>There's no reason <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">du'u</foreignphrase> should behave any differently than
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">nu</foreignphrase>, let alone
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sedu'u</foreignphrase>; so 

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mi djuno ledu'u <emphasis>ma</emphasis> cilre la
lojban.</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>means <quote>I know that <emphasis>who</emphasis>
is learning Lojban?</quote> &mdash; i.e. <quote><emphasis>Who</emphasis> do
I know is learning Lojban?</quote></para>

<para>What it does not mean is <quote>I know who is learning 
Lojban</quote> &mdash; as in <quote>I know the identity of the person 
learning Lojban.</quote> In a construction like that in English, you are 
not asking a real question; that's why this is called an <firstterm>indirect 
question</firstterm>. Instead, you 
are saying that you already <emphasis>know</emphasis> the answer to the 
question. You can tell the word <wordasword>who</wordasword> in that statement is 
not a request for information, because it is not at the start of the 
sentence, there's no question mark (or questioning intonation), and the 
question word is not being emphasised.</para>

<para>Lojban does not use any of these workarounds; a question word is a
question word in Lojban, wherever it happens to end up in the sentence. This means that
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi djuno ledu'u <emphasis>ma</emphasis>
cilre la lojban.</foreignphrase> can never be an indirect question: it is
asking for an answer. (It is asking for an answer even if you're doing it rhetorically, although that's
the kind of behaviour which Lojbanists &mdash; a level-headed bunch by most
accounts, at least when they're speaking in Lojban &mdash; might not
necessarily appreciate.) So what to do?</para>

<para>Well, let's look at what you do know. Let's say the person learning 
Lojban is Fred. If I ask you the question <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">ma cilre la lojban.</foreignphrase>, you know what value 
to fill in the <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ma</foreignphrase> slot 
with: <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la fred.</foreignphrase> So you 
could just say 

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi djuno ledu'u la fred. 
cilre la lojban.</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>For whatever reason, however, you're not 
telling me the actual name &mdash; totally within your prerogative. In 
fact, I could say about you that <quote><emphasis>You</emphasis> know who 
is learning Lojban</quote> &mdash; but because I don't know it, I have no name 
to fill in the <quote role="socalled">who</quote> slot with.</para>

<para>So you know that <emphasis>someone</emphasis> is learning Lojban:
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">do djuno ledu'u zo'e cilre la
lojban.</foreignphrase> And you can fill in the value of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">zo'e</foreignphrase>, even though I can't. What we want is
some word that would tell us <quote>the answer that goes here isn't being
said, but it is known anyway.</quote> That word is the UI <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase>, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">kau</foreignphrase>. So we can say:

<informalexample><literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi djuno ledu'u zo'e <emphasis>kau</emphasis> cilre la lojban.</foreignphrase>
I know someone is learning Lojban, and I know who it is.</literallayout>

</informalexample><informalexample><literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">do djuno ledu'u zo'e <emphasis>kau</emphasis> cilre la lojban.</foreignphrase>
You know someone is learning Lojban, and <emphasis>you</emphasis> know who it is.</literallayout></informalexample></para>

<para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">kau</foreignphrase> says that the value of the word it 
attaches to is known &mdash; whatever that word might be. So in fact, you can put 
it next to a question word, and it will cancel out the question word's 
force. <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mi djuno ledu'u <emphasis>ma kau</emphasis> cilre la
lojban.</foreignphrase> means exactly the same as <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mi djuno ledu'u <emphasis>zo'e kau</emphasis> cilre la
lojban.</foreignphrase> &mdash; and it has the advantage of looking just like 
the indirect questions we're already familiar with.</para>

<tip><para>Question words have the advantage that they are fairly devoid of 
content, so they don't make any presumptions you might not welcome. For 
example, if I know that no-one is learning Lojban, I can say <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mi djuno ledu'u makau cilre la lojban.</foreignphrase>; 
but I cannot say <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mi djuno ledu'u dakau cilre la lojban.</foreignphrase> 
&mdash; because <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">da</foreignphrase> by default means <quote 
role="gloss">at least one entity</quote>.</para></tip>

<para>Since <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">kau</foreignphrase> belongs to
<foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase> UI, you can place it pretty much anywhere. In
particular, anywhere you can put a question word in Lojban, you can turn it into
an indirect question by adding <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">kau</foreignphrase>. So you can say
<quote>I know how many people are learning Lojban</quote>, as

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi djuno ledu'u <emphasis>xo
kau</emphasis> prenu cilre la lojban.</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>(Remember,
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">xo</foreignphrase> is the question word
for numbers.)</para>

<para>You can even make indirect questions of Lojban's more exotic
question words. For example, in <link linkend="less11">Lesson 11</link>,
the waiter asks Jyoti and Susan <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lanme je'i
bakni</foreignphrase> <quote>lamb or beef?</quote> Once they answer, he
knows whether they want to eat lamb or beef; in Lojban, 

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ba'o lenu la djiotis. .e la suzyn. spuda kei le bevri cu
djuno ledu'u ra djica lenu citka loi lanme <emphasis>je'i kau</emphasis>

</simplesect>



</sect1>

<sect1 id="less15cehu"><title>Properties</title>

<para>We have seen, here and there, instances of Lojban expressions of
properties. Lojban treats properties as abstractions, introduced by
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ka</foreignphrase>. There is nothing
controversial about that; properties are things you can talk about
(<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>), which involve
relationships and characteristics (<foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>.) So if <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">xendo</foreignphrase> means <quote 
role="gloss">kind</quote>, for instance, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">le ka xendo</foreignphrase> refers to <quote 
role="gloss">kindness</quote>.</para>

<para>The thing about properties, though, is that they are properties
<emphasis>of</emphasis> something. They are associated, not just with a
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>, but with a
particular place of the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>. For instance, if I am being kind
(<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi xendo</foreignphrase>), then I can
talk about <emphasis>my</emphasis> kindness:

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">le ka <emphasis>mi</emphasis> xendo</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>If
Fred is being kind, we would instead speak of <emphasis>Fred</emphasis>'s
kindness:

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le ka <emphasis>la
fred.</emphasis> xendo</foreignphrase></para></informalexample></para>

<para>Now, consider influence and susceptibility. Both involve the
relationship expressed in Lojban as <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">xlura</foreignphrase>:

<informalexample><para>x<subscript>1</subscript> (agent)
influences/lures/tempts x<subscript>2</subscript> into action/state x<subscript>3</subscript> by influence/threat/lure
x<subscript>4</subscript></para>

</informalexample>So the Lojban for influence is <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">le ka xlura</foreignphrase>. And the Lojban for
susceptibility is... <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le ka
xlura</foreignphrase>? No, that can't be right. Let's try again.</para>

<para>Influence
is the property associated with the x<subscript>1</subscript> of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">xlura</foreignphrase>, the influencer. Susceptibility is
the property associated with the x<subscript>2</subscript> of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">xlura</foreignphrase>, the influencee. I need to somehow,
in the abstraction, highlight the place I'm interested in: <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">le ka <emphasis>mi</emphasis> xlura</foreignphrase> is my
influence, while <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le
ka xlura <emphasis>mi</emphasis></foreignphrase> is my susceptibility.</para>
 
<para>I could play tricks like using whichever place comes first, or whichever place is empty 
first, to tell which place I'm concentrating on. But that would just be a 
convention; and as was the case with relative clauses and <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ke'a</foreignphrase>, you'd want some way of explicitly 
spelling out what place you're concentrating on. Moreover, what happens if 
both candidate places are filled? If I say 

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">le ka mi xlura do</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>am I referring to my influence over you, 
or your susceptibility to me? Who are we concentrating on here?
</para>

<para>The solution Lojban presents is pretty similar to relative clauses
and <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ke'a</foreignphrase>, as it turns out.
(Some logicians would think of it as identical, in fact.) It's also similar
to Lojban's approach to questions. Remember in <link
linkend="less13">Lesson 13</link> that the search for extraterrestrial
intelligence was, in terms of Lojban, a search for the value to fit in the
slot 

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">leka ___ terdi bartu
pensi</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>By the same token, influence is a property of things
that fit into the x<subscript>1</subscript> place of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">xlura</foreignphrase>; so you can think of influence as
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">leka ___ xlura</foreignphrase>. If we
know that <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi</foreignphrase> fits into the
slot, we have <quote role="gloss">my influence</quote>; if we know that
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la fred.</foreignphrase> fits into the
slot, we have <quote role="gloss">Fred's influence</quote>. And
susceptibility is a property of things that fit into the x<subscript>2</subscript> place of
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">xlura</foreignphrase>; so you can think of
susceptibility as <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le ka xlura
___</foreignphrase> (or <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le ka ___ se
xlura</foreignphrase>.)</para>

<para>Lojban has a word for that slot associated with properties. It isn't
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ma</foreignphrase>, because you're not
asking someone what fills the slot; you're just pointing out that there's a
slot there that can be filled. It isn't <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ke'a</foreignphrase> either, because <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ke'a</foreignphrase> refers back to something you've
already expressed as a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> (though you might think of a
relative clause as a property belonging to that <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>.) Property slots get their own KOhA
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase>, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ce'u</foreignphrase>. So:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Influence is <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">le ka ce'u xlura</foreignphrase> <quote>the property 
that <wordasword>x</wordasword> influences</quote>: anyone or anything that
has that property can stand in for <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ce'u</foreignphrase>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Susceptibility is <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">le ka xlura ce'u</foreignphrase> <quote>the property 
that [something] influences <wordasword>x</wordasword></quote>, or <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">le ka ce'u se xlura</foreignphrase> <quote>the property 
that <wordasword>x</wordasword> is influenced</quote>: anyone or anything
that has <emphasis>that</emphasis> property can stand in for <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ce'u</foreignphrase>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>And extraterrestrial intelligence is
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le ka ce'u terdi bartu
pensi</foreignphrase> <quote>the property that <wordasword>x</wordasword> is an earth-exterior 
thinker.</quote> You can tell whether you've found your Little Green
Men by substituting them for <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ce'u</foreignphrase>, and seeing if the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase> is true:

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le ka ce'u xlura da de di</foreignphrase></para>

<informalexample><para>&lambda;<wordasword>x</wordasword>.<foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">xendo</foreignphrase>(<wordasword>x</wordasword>,<foreignphrase

lang="art-lojban">di</foreignphrase>)</para>

</informalexample>The rest of you (which includes 90%
of all programmers and 99% of all linguists) can go ahead and forget I ever
mentioned this.</para></note>

<para>When there is no <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ce'u</foreignphrase> in the abstraction, the location of
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ce'u</foreignphrase> is ambiguous, and <citetitle>The
Complete Lojban Language</citetitle> mentions no
convention having arisen, like with <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ke'a</foreignphrase>, on where it goes by default. The x<subscript>1</subscript>
place (whether occupied or not) appears to be what Lojbanists assume. This means that
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le ka xlura</foreignphrase> without <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">ce'u</foreignphrase>
means both <quote role="gloss">influence</quote> and <quote
role="gloss">susceptibility</quote>, although <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">le ka se xlura</foreignphrase> seems to be the
preferred way of saying <quote role="gloss">susceptibility</quote>.</para>

<para>What happens if you want to put <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ce'u</foreignphrase> in the abstraction, but the place
you want to put it is already occupied, because you know who it's a
property of? Well, in that case you want to say that the value already
there takes up the space where the slot would be. If <quote
role="gloss">kindness</quote> is <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le ka
ce'u xendo</foreignphrase>, <quote role="gloss">my kindness</quote> is
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le ka ce'u xendo fa mi</foreignphrase>.
This means that both <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ce'u</foreignphrase>
and <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi</foreignphrase> take up the x<subscript>1</subscript> of
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">xendo</foreignphrase>. A somewhat less
painful way to do this is to use <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">po'u</foreignphrase> to say that the property slot and
the value filling it are basically the same thing:

<informalexample><literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le ka ce'u po'u mi xendo</foreignphrase> 
the quality of <wordasword>x</wordasword>, namely me, being kind.</literallayout></informalexample></para>

<sect1 id="less15tuha"><title>From <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> to abstraction: <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">tu'a</foreignphrase></title>

<para>When looking up words in a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> list, you will have already noticed
that, where languages like English have people or things as subjects and
objects, Lojban often uses abstractions instead as <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> places. For example, in
English, you say that <emphasis>someone</emphasis> is interesting, or
<emphasis>something</emphasis> is interesting. In Lojban, you aren't really
meant to say either. The definition of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cinri</foreignphrase> is:

<informalexample><para>x<subscript>1</subscript>
(abstraction) interests/is interesting to x<subscript>2</subscript>; x<subscript>2</subscript> is interested in
x<subscript>1</subscript></para>

</informalexample>In other words, as far as Lojban is concerned, it's not things
or people that are interesting, but <emphasis>actions</emphasis> or
<emphasis>properties</emphasis> involving those things or people. For
example, Jyoti cannot be said to be interesting simply by virtue of being
Jyoti; the way Lojban puts it, it's the things Jyoti does (or is) that are
interesting &mdash; the way she talks about British sitcoms, her choice of 
headgear, her tendency to break into '80s songs after she's had a few 
drinks. (Oh, I forgot to tell you about all that. Maybe next course.)</para>

<para>The same goes for <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fenki</foreignphrase> <quote role="gloss">crazy</quote>.
In almost every language, it is people that are called crazy. Only occasionally
are actions also called crazy. Lojban, however, defines <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fenki</foreignphrase> as:

<informalexample><para>x<subscript>1</subscript>
(action/event) is crazy/insane/mad/frantic/in a frenzy (one sense) by
standard x<subscript>2</subscript></para>

</informalexample>In other words, as far as Lojban is concerned,
craziness lies in actions, not in people; a crazy person is by definition
someone who does crazy actions.</para>

<note><para>This means that someone suffering from
the particular forms of mental illness loosely called <quote
role="socalled">crazy</quote> wouldn't be called <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fenki</foreignphrase> in Lojban &mdash; since their
condition is not <emphasis>primarily</emphasis> a matter of socially
unaceptable actions &mdash; but rather <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">menli
bilma</foreignphrase>: <quote role="gloss">mentally ill</quote>.</para></note>

<para>For now, you may be prepared to accept this as an endearing quirk of
Lojban. (If you're not, we explain why Lojban is all topsy-turvy like this
in the next section.) But very often, you have no idea what to say is
the <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> of that 
abstraction, or you don't particularly care to. For example, yes, Jyoti 
doing this, that and the other is what is interesting about her; but I may 
not know first-hand what exactly her particular talents are, or I may not feel 
like going into a five-minute spiel every time I merely want to point out 
that she is interesting. If I can't say the Lojban for <quote>Jyoti is 
interesting</quote>, I should at least be able to say something like 
<quote>Jyoti {doing some stuff I'm not listing here} is 
interesting</quote>, or <quote>Some things about Jyoti are 
interesting.</quote> In other words, I have to say 

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">lenu la djiotis. cu ___ cu cinri</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>but I 
shouldn't have to fill in that slot with an explicit <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> each time.</para>

<para>There are slots in Lojban sentences that we have in fact been leaving
empty all the time. Remember <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">zo'e</foreignphrase>? <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">zo'e</foreignphrase> is the <quote role="socalled">don't
care</quote> value we leave implied in the places of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase> we leave empty. For example, when I
say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi klama le barja</foreignphrase>, I'm
not bothering to specify my point of origin, route, or vehicle. They are
all implied to be <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">zo'e</foreignphrase>:
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi klama le barja zo'e zo'e
zo'e</foreignphrase>. This means that there is a point of origin, a route and a vehicle
involved, but we don't really care what they are.</para>

<para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">zo'e</foreignphrase> is a
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>; but it has a
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> equivalent,
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">co'e</foreignphrase>. <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">co'e</foreignphrase> can appear where any <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> can appear, but it leaves the
relationship between its <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> unspecified. So <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mi co'e le barja</foreignphrase> means something like
<quote>I thingummy the bar</quote>: the bar and I are in some relationship,
but I'm not bothering to say what it is. I might be going to it, coming
from it, sleeping in it, refurbishing it, or hearing about my neighbour
getting drunk in it once. It just doesn't matter enough for me to say
what.</para>

<para>Now normally, you can't get away with this: if you leave out the
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> in your story, you
pretty much have no story. But with these abstractions that we wish weren't
really abstractions, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">co'e</foreignphrase>
is just what you need: you can get away with making an abstraction
containing only the <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>
you want to talk about. You don't have to specify
<emphasis>anything</emphasis> else in the abstraction &mdash; especially
not the <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>. So if I
want to say <quote>Jyoti is interesting</quote>, I need only say

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lenu la djiotis. cu
<emphasis>co'e</emphasis> cu cinri</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>I'm still saying an
abstraction involving Jyoti is what is interesting, so I'm following the
requirements of the <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase>
list. But that's all I'm saying; what particular abstraction it is that is
interesting, I am leaving entirely open. In the same way, if I want to say
<quote>Zhang is crazy</quote> (or <quote>berserk</quote>, probably a closer
translation of <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">fenki</foreignphrase>), I
don't have to enumerate the various wacky stunts he has pulled over the
years. I can simply say that <quote>some stuff about Zhang is
crazy</quote>, which in Lojban comes out as

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">lenu la jan. <emphasis>co'e</emphasis> cu fenki</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>The value of
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">co'e</foreignphrase> could be

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">dasni [loi zirpu]</foreignphrase>
<quote>wears purple</quote></para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">dansu [la
zgikrfanki jipci]</foreignphrase> <quote>dances the Funky Chicken</quote></para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">tavla [bau la lojban.]</foreignphrase>
<quote>speaks Lojban</quote></para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>or whatever; we're just not bothering to name
it here.</para>

<para>Lojban can go one better, though. As you can tell, Lojban is going to
have you saying <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lenu ___ cu co'e
kei</foreignphrase> quite often (and you never know when you might need that
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">kei</foreignphrase> terminator); so it
offers you an abbreviation: <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">tu'a</foreignphrase>. <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">tu'a da</foreignphrase> means <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">lesu'u da cu co'e kei</foreignphrase>; (where <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">su'u</foreignphrase>, you may recall, is the generic 
abstractor); so you can translate
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">tu'a</foreignphrase> as <quote>some
abstraction associated with...</quote>, or more colloquially, <quote>some
stuff about...</quote> <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">tu'a</foreignphrase> is easily the most popular way of
dealing with abstractions you wish weren't there in Lojban; Lojban
sentences using it come out fairly similar to the natural language
sentences <emphasis>without</emphasis> abstractions that we're used to seeing.
So the usual Lojban for <quote>Jyoti is interesting</quote> is

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis>tu'a</emphasis> la djiotis.
cinri</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>and the usual Lojban for <quote>Zhang is
crazy</quote> is 

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis>tu'a</emphasis>
la jan. fenki</foreignphrase></para></informalexample></para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="less15jai"><title>Raising: <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">jai</foreignphrase></title>

<warning><para>This section is long and complicated. On the plus side, 
it's also the final section in the course.</para></warning>

<para>Things weren't always like this. In the '80s, the ancestor of Lojban
still said that things were interesting, and people were crazy, just like
most normal languages, and without detouring through abstractions. So what
happened?</para>

<para>Well, what happened was that Lojbanists noticed how linguists have
been analysing these concepts in natural languages, and how they were
coming up with their own versions of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>. Often, what was a noun in
one part of the sentence, and a verb in another part, were brought together
and considered to be underlyingly part of the same abstraction
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>.</para>

<note><para>The word for <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> in English, by the way, is
<wordasword>predicates</wordasword>; we've been avoiding it up to now, but
we think you can handle the truth from now on...</para></note>

<para>A good example is the phrase <wordasword>I am difficult to
annoy</wordasword> in English. At first sight, you might think that
<wordasword>I</wordasword> is a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> of
<wordasword>difficult</wordasword>. And grammatically it is: it's the
subject. But logically it isn't: what we're describing as difficult is not
<wordasword>me</wordasword>. We can't say:

<informalexample><itemizedlist><listitem><para>Who is difficult?</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Me (to annoy)</para></listitem></itemizedlist>

</informalexample>What's actually going on is that,
underlyingly, what is difficult is <wordasword>to annoy me</wordasword>:
the action of getting me annoyed is what is hard to achieve &mdash; not me!
This is why English also allows you to say <wordasword>It is difficult to
annoy me</wordasword>, and (if you squint a little) <wordasword>To annoy me
is difficult</wordasword>. And sure enough, Lojban expresses this concept
according to that <quote role="socalled">underlying</quote> form:

<informalexample><literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lenu fanza mi cu nandu</foreignphrase>
The event of annoying me is difficult</literallayout></informalexample></para>

<para>So why did English pull that weird switcheroo with <wordasword>I am
difficult to annoy</wordasword>? Basically, because when we talk, we aren't
concentrating in our minds on intangible abstractions like <quote>the event
of annoying me</quote>, let alone <quote>the state of Jyoti having certain
unspecified properties.</quote> Instead, we run little stories in our head,
with heroes and villains: concrete heroes and villains &mdash; people, for
the most part. And as it happens, we make the subjects of our sentences be
the heroes and villains we're concentrating on. (That's what a subject's
ultimate job is: to present what we're concentrating on.)</para>

<para>So by pulling a
switcheroo like that, we're not talking about abstractions and events any
more; the subject of the sentence is now our perennially favourite subject
&mdash; namely <emphasis>me</emphasis>: it's <emphasis>me</emphasis> that 
is difficult to annoy. (Yes, it <emphasis>is</emphasis>
all about me...) This process is called in linguistics
<firstterm>raising</firstterm>, because it raises concrete subjects (and
objects) we want to talk about, out of the haziness of an abstraction
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> (or <quote
role="socalled">clausal argument</quote>, to use English logical
terminology.)</para>

<para>Once the requisite number of Lojbanists did an undergraduate course
in syntax (you may commence throwing darts at effigies of Nick Nicholas at
your leisure), it was realised that there were a <emphasis>lot</emphasis>
of <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> whose place
structures contained both a raised concrete <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> (usually x<subscript>1</subscript>), and an abstraction
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> which itself
contained the first <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>.
For example, the place structure of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fenki</foreignphrase> used to be 

<informalexample><para>x<subscript>1</subscript> is crazy
in behaviour x<subscript>2</subscript> (abstraction) by standard x<subscript>3</subscript>.</para> 

</informalexample>But
<emphasis>any</emphasis> abstraction that would go into x<subscript>2</subscript> would contain
the x<subscript>1</subscript> <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>: any crazy
behaviour would automatically be the behaviour of the crazy person. For
example, you'd get 

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la jan. fenki lenu la
jan. dasni loi zirpu</foreignphrase></para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la
jan. fenki lenu la jan. dansu la jipci</foreignphrase></para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">la jan. fenki lenu la jan. tavla bau la
lojban.</foreignphrase></para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>The question then became: does the x<subscript>1</subscript> tell us
anything the x<subscript>2</subscript> wasn't already telling us? We'd know who was involved in
the crazy behaviour, because that person would be a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> inside x<subscript>2</subscript>. Was there any reason to 
grant the person an extra place in the overall <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase>? The decision was, no: behaviour is what 
is crazy, so you can work out that the person acting out the behaviour is 
the crazy person. There's no need to have an extra place for the person, 
when you can already work out who they are. The same conclusion was arrived 
at for <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cinri</foreignphrase>: it is 
abstractions &mdash; events and qualities &mdash; that attract interest; 
and an interesting person is simply a person involved in an interesting 
abstraction.</para>

<para>All well and good; but natural languages do raising for a reason.
So when Lojban has its <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> 
without raising, it gains in eliminating redundancy and logical muddledness; 
but it loses in <quote role="socalled">naturalness</quote>. We like 
talking about people rather than abstractions in our languages; and Lojban 
should not go out of its way to form an exception to this.</para>

<para>There is a solution of sorts to this problem using <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">tu'a</foreignphrase>; but it doesn't actually do what
raising does in natural languages: it doesn't <emphasis>change</emphasis>
the x<subscript>1</subscript> place from an abstraction to a concrete <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>. And there are times you will want
to do just that.</para>

<para>One example is joining <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase>-tails. In English, you can say
<wordasword>Jyoti is interesting and beautiful.</wordasword> This is
based on two sentences (<wordasword>Jyoti is interesting</wordasword>,
<wordasword>Jyoti is beautiful</wordasword>) which have the same
subject. So we can easily combine them into a single sentence. In Lojban,
the equivalent sentences are 

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">tu'a la
djiotis. cinri</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>and 

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la djiotis. 
melbi</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>There is no way you're going to
join those two <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase>
together with <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gi'e</foreignphrase>: they
simply do not have their first <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> in common. But they're both 
somehow <quote role="socalled">about</quote> Jyoti; so you really should be 
able to work around this.</para>

<para>An even more important instance when you want raising is in forming
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> out of this kind of
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase>. A <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> means whatever goes into the x<subscript>1</subscript> of
its <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>. If
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la djiotis. ninmu</foreignphrase> <quote>Jyoti is a woman</quote>, then I
can describe Jyoti as <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lo
ninmu</foreignphrase> <quote role="gloss">a woman</quote>. If
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lemi karce cu xe klama le gusta fu
mi</foreignphrase> <quote>My car is a vehicle to the restaurant for me</quote>, then I can describe <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">lemi karce</foreignphrase> as <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">lo xe klama</foreignphrase> <quote role="gloss">a
vehicle</quote>. So how do I say that someone is a cheat, or a deceiver?
The <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> for <quote
role="gloss">deceive</quote>, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">tcica</foreignphrase>, has the place structure 

<informalexample><para>x<subscript>1</subscript> (event/experience)
misleads/deceives/dupes/fools/cheats/tricks x<subscript>2</subscript> into x<subscript>3</subscript>
(event/state)</para>

</informalexample>This means that, while in English we say that x<quote><subscript>1</subscript> deceives x<subscript>2</subscript> into
doing x<subscript>3</subscript>, by doing x<subscript>4</subscript></quote>, in Lojban the person and the action are merged into
the one place. That makes <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lo tcica</foreignphrase>
a trick, not a trickster; a deception, and not a deceiver.
To say that someone is a trickster or a deceiver,
we need to use <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">tu'a</foreignphrase>:
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">tu'a da tcica</foreignphrase>. But you
can't put <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lo</foreignphrase> in front of
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">tu'a da</foreignphrase>: the deceiver
has to be the x<subscript>1</subscript> of some <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>, in order to get their own
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>.</para>

<para>The solution to this is to force Lojban to have raising after all,
changing its place structure by modifying the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> involved. This works just like
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">se</foreignphrase> changing the place
structure of its <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>,
swapping its first and second place. If we put <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">jai</foreignphrase> in front of a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>, its x<subscript>1</subscript> place changes from an
abstraction, to any <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>
contained <emphasis>within</emphasis> the abstraction. Let's try this with 
a few sentences:

<informalexample>

<listitem>
<para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis>mi</emphasis> jai nandu</foreignphrase>
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist></listitem></itemizedlist></informalexample></para>

<para>You'll notice that, with these new place structures, the Lojban
phrases sound pretty much like their English equivalents. For example,

<informalexample><literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la djiotis. cu jai cinri</foreignphrase> 
Jyoti is interesting</literallayout>

</informalexample><informalexample><literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la ranjit. jai tcica la suzyn.</foreignphrase>
Ranjeet deceives Susan</literallayout></informalexample></para>

<para>We can now do with <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">jai</foreignphrase> those things we couldn't before. The
Lojban for <quote>Jyoti is interesting and beautiful</quote>, for example,
is 

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la djiotis. cu jai cinri gi'e
melbi</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>That's because Jyoti goes in the x<subscript>1</subscript> place of
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">jai cinri</foreignphrase>, just as it goes
into the x<subscript>1</subscript> place of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">melbi</foreignphrase>. And if I want to make a
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> meaning <quote
role="gloss">deceiver</quote> or <quote role="gloss">trickster</quote>, I
can use <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">jai</foreignphrase> to do it:

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis>tu'a la ranjit.</emphasis>
tcica</foreignphrase> &rArr; <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis>la
ranjit.</emphasis> jai tcica</foreignphrase> &rArr; <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban"><emphasis>lo jai
tcica</emphasis></foreignphrase></para></informalexample></para>

<para>However, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi jai
nandu</foreignphrase> does <emphasis>not</emphasis> correspond to <quote>I am difficult to
annoy.</quote> In switching a concrete <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> for the original x<subscript>1</subscript> &mdash; the
abstraction that was difficult &mdash; we have lost the abstraction itself: there
is nothing in <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi jai nandu</foreignphrase>
that means <quote role="gloss">to annoy</quote>. But not to worry: Lojban
allows you to keep the original abstraction in the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase> by preceding it with <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fai</foreignphrase>. <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fai</foreignphrase> is a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase> like <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fa</foreignphrase> and <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fe</foreignphrase>; it effectively adds a new place to
the <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase>. So <wordasword>I am
difficult to annoy</wordasword> is matched almost word-for-word by the Lojban
sentence 

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi jai nandu fai lenu fanza
mi</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>And we can apply this pattern further afield; for
example, <quote>the book took three months to write</quote> is in Lojban
properly 

<informalexample><literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lenu finti le cukta cu masti li ci</foreignphrase> 
To write the book had a month-duration of three</literallayout>

</informalexample>Raising allows the slightly more familiar-looking

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le cukta cu jai masti li ci fai lenu
finti</foreignphrase></para></informalexample></para>

<para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">jai</foreignphrase> has not proven
as popular as <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">tu'a</foreignphrase>,
presumably because it involves a fairly thorough rearrangement of place
structures &mdash; and has the whiff about being somehow <quote
role="socalled">un-Lojbanic</quote>. But as we've seen, it allows you to
talk about things in a way that is in many ways more natural; and though it
belongs to <quote role="socalled">advanced</quote> Lojban, it is a feature 
you will find it useful to be familiar with.</para>

<simplesect role="exercise"><title>Exercise 4</title>

<para>That was pretty heavy going. You can relax: this exercise will go easy on you.
(You still have the final translation exercises to go through, after all!) Where possible,
and by all means necessary, recast the abstractions in the following sentences so that they
use <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">jai</foreignphrase> (and

</itemizedlist>And with that, we have reached the end of the <citetitle>Lojban for 
Beginners</citetitle> course! There are several bits of the grammar of 
Lojban not covered here; but you now have the essentials with which to 
start using Lojban, and you are in a good position to pick up the rest 
&mdash; preferably from <citetitle>The Complete Lojban 
Language</citetitle>, which is a fairly easy read for a reference grammar. 
Moreover, most of the Lojban you will see will stick fairly closely to the

<listitem><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mi nelci le cidjrkari</foreignphrase>
(The <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> list explicitly allows <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">nelci</foreignphrase> to involve both objects and 
events; so you don't need <foreignphrase

(Yes, you read correctly. To fit the x<subscript>1</subscript> of <foreignphrase

<emphasis>look like</emphasis> an abstraction; it just has to 
<emphasis>mean</emphasis> an abstraction. Anything that can be described 
as <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">le fanza</foreignphrase> is going to be an abstraction, 
because of the place structure of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fanza</foreignphrase>. So since the x<subscript>1</subscript> of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fanza</foreignphrase> is a state or event, and the x<subscript>1</subscript> of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cfari</foreignphrase> is also a state or event, they can

(As this indicates, the x<subscript>3</subscript> place of <foreignphrase

Since you have wide liberty in stating what you know about a subject, however, this won't neecssarily always be the case:

<informalexample><literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i mi djuno ledu'u loi cidro ku joi loi kijno cu cupra loi djacu kei loi xumske</foreignphrase>

lang="art-lojban">xi re</foreignphrase> <quote role="gloss">subscript 2</quote> helpfully keep them 
apart. You're not really encouraged to do this kind of thing, though; after all, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">jai</foreignphrase> was intended to make Lojban more natural &mdash; not more 
wacky!</para></note></para></listitem>

<para>Since what you're describing is
a thing or person (a person, in this case), that means that <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">da poi da jai nandu fai lenu fanza</foreignphrase> should be a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>, with <foreignphrase
