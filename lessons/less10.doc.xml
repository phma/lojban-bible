<chapter id="less10"><title>Cause and Effect</title>

<para>Most children go through a phase where every second sentence seems to
start with <wordasword>why?</wordasword> For example:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Why is it raining?</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Why did Sally hit me?</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Why does Sally always get a star from the teacher?</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Why did Fluffy have to die?</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

To these, the frustrated parent may give a series of answers with
<wordasword>because</wordasword>:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Because the clouds are crying.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Because you pulled her hair.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Because she works hard.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Because Fluffy is a rabbit, and rabbits don't live very long.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>What neither the child nor his long-suffering parent are aware of is
that in these examples, the <wordasword>why</wordasword>s ask different
questions and the <wordasword>because</wordasword>s give different kinds of
answers. In some languages, in fact, we would use different words for them:
Turkish has three words for <wordasword>why</wordasword>, and until
recently even English had two (the other being
<wordasword>wherefore</wordasword>, as in <quote>wherefore art thou
Romeo?</quote>). We would expect, then, that Lojban would have at least
four words for <wordasword>why</wordasword>, but in fact it doesn't, since all
questions are handled with <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ma, mo</foreignphrase>
and <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">xo</foreignphrase>. What Lojban <emphasis>does</emphasis>
have is four words for <wordasword>because</wordasword>. </para>


<sect1 id="less10phys"><title>Physical causation</title>

<para>Going back to the first question, <quote>Why does it rain?</quote>,
the child is asking for a physical explanation, and this is what he gets.
If we express the rather unlikely explanation in Lojban, we get

<informalexample>
<literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lenu lei dilnu cu klaku cu rinka lenu carvi</foreignphrase>
the-event the-mass-of cloud weep physically-cause the-event rain
The clouds' crying is making it rain.
</literallayout>
</informalexample>

<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">rinka</foreignphrase> means <quote
role="gloss">cause</quote> in a physical or mechanical sense. To change
this <quote role="gloss">cause</quote> to a <quote
role="gloss">because</quote>, we can use <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ri'a</foreignphrase>. This is a <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti
tcita</foreignphrase> derived from <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">rinka</foreignphrase>, in the same way that we saw
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">de'i</foreignphrase> derived from <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">detri</foreignphrase> in <link linkend="less5">Lesson 5</link>. 
So it adds a new place to the <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase> 
it sits in:
just as <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">de'i</foreignphrase> means <quote 
role="gloss">with
date</quote>, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ri'a</foreignphrase> means
<quote role="gloss">with physical cause</quote>. This means we can now say

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">
carvi ri'a lenu lei dilnu cu klaku
</foreignphrase></para></informalexample>

which is much more elegant. (Note that Lojban does not need the empty
<wordasword>it</wordasword> in <quote>It's raining</quote>.) </para>

<para>The reason I have emphasised that <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">rinka</foreignphrase> and <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ri'a</foreignphrase> only deal with
<emphasis>physical</emphasis> causes is that it cannot apply in many cases
where an English-speaker would use <wordasword>because</wordasword>. Consider the
second example. If we say

<informalexample>
<literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la salis. darxi do ri'a lenu do lacpu lei kerfa</foreignphrase>
Sally hits you with-physical-cause you pull the-mass-of hair
</literallayout>
</informalexample>

this is nonsense, since it means that little Joey's pulling Sally's hair
physically caused her to hit him, which would only be true if Joey had
pulled her hair so hard that she had fallen on top of him, perhaps. </para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="less10motiv"><title>Motivation</title>

<para>In the hair-pulling case, what we have is not two events which are
physically connected, like clouds and rain, but three events:

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Joey pulls Sally's hair.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Sally decides, as a result of this, to hit Joey.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Sally hits Joey.</para></listitem>

</orderedlist>
</para>

<para>For the sake of convenience, English misses out the second event and
says <quote>Sally hit Joey because he pulled her hair.</quote> However,
this is not only vague but, some would say, psychologically dangerous.
People do not generally react to stimuli automatically, but as a result of
motivation, and confusing complex responses with simple physical causation
may lead us to believe that we have no control over our emotions or even
our actions. Whether or not we believe in free will at a metaphysical
level, it is useful to distinguish between physical reactions and responses
which have a cognitive/emotional element. Not surprisingly, then, Lojban
has a separate <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> for
motivation: <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mukti</foreignphrase>. The full
definition of <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mukti</foreignphrase> is

<informalexample><para>x1 (action/event/state) motivates/is a
motive/incentive for action/event x2, per volition of x3
</para></informalexample>

We can therefore say

<informalexample>
<literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lenu do lacpu lei kerfa [pe la salis.] cu mukti lenu la salis. darxi do [kei la salis]</foreignphrase>
the-event you pull the-mass hair [related-to Sally] motivates the-event Sally hit you [through the volition of Sally]
Your pulling Sally's hair motivated her to hit you.
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
</para>

<para>As we can see, the third place is nearly always unnecessary, since we
can assume that the agent of the second event is also the person who
decides to do it. Even so, this structure is a bit clumsy, so again we
would normally use a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti tcita</foreignphrase>, in this case, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mu'i</foreignphrase>. This gives us

<informalexample>
<literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la salis. darxi do mu'i lenu do lacpu lei kerfa</foreignphrase>
Sally hits you with-motive you pull the-mass hair
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="less10just"><title>Justification and Implication</title>

<para>The difference between motivation and justification is not always
clear, but we can say that the latter involves some rule or standard while
the former does not require this. Going back to the example of Sally and
the teacher, it is possible to say

<informalexample>
<literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la salis. te dunda lo tartcita le ctuca mu'i lenu sy. tcetoi gunka</foreignphrase>
Sally is-given a star-label [by] the teacher with-motivation she much-try work
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
</para>

<para>However, this says only that Sally's hard work motivated the teacher
to give her a star. It does not imply that it is the custom for teachers to
give stars (or <quote role="socalled">star-labels</quote>, as I have rather
pedantically translated it) as a reward for good work. What we need here is
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ki'u</foreignphrase>, the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti tcita</foreignphrase> from <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">krinu</foreignphrase> (<quote>x1 (event/state) is a
reason/justification/explanation for/causing/permitting x2
(event/state)</quote>). We can therefore more accurately say

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">
lenu la salis. tcetoi gunka cu krinu lenu le ctuca cu dunda lo tartcita sy
</foreignphrase></para></informalexample>

or, as in the earlier example,

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">
la salis. te dunda lo tartcita le ctuca ki'u lenu sy. tcetoi gunka
</foreignphrase></para></informalexample>
</para>

<note><para>Don't get <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ki'u</foreignphrase> mixed
up with <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ku'i</foreignphrase> <quote
role="gloss">but, however</quote>! </para></note>

<para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ki'u</foreignphrase> appeals to more
general considerations than <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mu'i</foreignphrase>,
but it still deals with human standards, not logical laws. Only a very naive
student would believe that if a student is given a star, it must logically
imply that that student has worked hard. In the tragic case of Fluffy,
however, the fact that Fluffy is a rabbit logically implies that he will
not live long, given what we know about rabbits. Here we can confidently
use <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">nibli</foreignphrase>: <quote>x1 logically
necessitates/entails/implies action/event/state x2 under rules/logic system
x3</quote>. The sentence

<informalexample>
<literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lenu la flufis. ractu cu nibli lenu fy. mrobi'o</foreignphrase>
the-event Fluffy is-a-rabbit implies the-event he dies
</literallayout>
</informalexample>

actually misses out a step (the information that rabbits are short-lived)
but it will do for practical purposes. If you want a textbook logic
example, you can say

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">
la flufis. ractu .ije ro ractu na'e ze'u jmive .i la flufis. seni'i na ze'u jmive
</foreignphrase></para></informalexample>

This expresses the following:

<orderedlist>

<listitem><para>Fluffy is a rabbit <emphasis>and</emphasis> all rabbits are
not long-lived.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Fluffy is therefore not long-lived. </para></listitem>

</orderedlist>
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="less10conn"><title>Connecting and converting</title>

<para>The reason I have included this blindingly obvious piece of logic is
that it demonstrates how sentences can be joined, and how <quote
role="gloss">because</quote> can be turned into <quote
role="gloss">therefore</quote>. We've seen how <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.i</foreignphrase> shows that a new sentence is starting;
but we can also tag things onto the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.i</foreignphrase>. We've seen (in passing) that two
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> can be joined with
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.e</foreignphrase>. In the same way,
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.ije</foreignphrase> joins two sentences
with a logical <wordasword>and</wordasword>, i.e. it asserts that both
sentences are true. Normally we don't need to do this, since we usually
assume that what we say is true; but it is useful here, because it binds
the first two sentences together, so that when the <quote
role="socalled">conclusion</quote> sentence comes, it <quote
role="socalled">therefores</quote> both of them, not just the second. (This
is called <quote role="socalled">left-grouping</quote> and there are ways
to over-ride it, but that's not important for now.) </para>

<note><para>Again, this sentence misses out a number of logical steps, including
the fact that Fluffy is a rabbit and that he had lived out his rabbit life
naturally, rather than getting eaten by a dog &mdash; but you get the idea,
I hope. </para></note>

<para>So what is <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">seni'i</foreignphrase> doing in front of the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>? Lojban treats <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti tcita</foreignphrase> the same as tenses; so <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">seni'i</foreignphrase> can go in front of the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>, as if it was a tense. This 
corresponds to an adverb like <wordasword>therefore</wordasword> in 
English.</para>

<para>What we're left with is a <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti
tcita</foreignphrase>, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">seni'i</foreignphrase>, which we haven't yet explained.
Actually, though, you've seen enough to work this out from <link
linkend="less9">Lesson 9</link>. As you saw there, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti tcita</foreignphrase> can be modified with
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">se, te, ve, xe</foreignphrase>, just like
their underlying <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase>.
You'll have guessed by now that <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ni'i</foreignphrase> is a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti tcita</foreignphrase> meaning <quote
role="gloss">logically because of</quote>. In other words, the
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> introduced by
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ni'i</foreignphrase> is <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">le nibli</foreignphrase> <quote role="gloss">that which
logically necessitates.</quote> This makes <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">se ni'i</foreignphrase> a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti tcita</foreignphrase> introducing <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">le se nibli</foreignphrase> &mdash; <quote
role="gloss">that which is logically necessitated; the logical
result.</quote> And so

<informalexample>
<literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la flufis. mrobi'o ni'i lenu ro ractu na'e ze'u jmive</foreignphrase>
Fluffy past die with-logical-necessity the-event all rabbits other-than long-time-period live
Fluffy died because rabbits don't live long.
</literallayout>
</informalexample>

is the same as

<informalexample>
<literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ro ractu na'e ze'u jmive seni'i lenu la flufis. mrobi'o</foreignphrase>
Rabbits don't live long, with the logical consequence that Fluffy died.
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
</para>

<para>We can apply this principle to the other <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti tcita</foreignphrase> we've looked at. Here are some examples:

<informalexample>
<literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le lante cu spoja ri'a lenu ri pu glare</foreignphrase>
the can explode with-physical-cause the-event it past is-hot
The can exploded because it was hot.
</literallayout>
</informalexample>

<informalexample>
<literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le lante pu glare seri'a lenu ri spoja</foreignphrase>
the can past is-hot with-physical-result the-event it explode
The can was hot, so it exploded. 
</literallayout>
</informalexample>

<informalexample>
<literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">so'i prenu cu nelci la djiotis. mu'i lenu ri xajmi</foreignphrase>
many people like Jyoti with-motivation the-event she is-funny
Many people like Jyoti because she's funny.
</literallayout>
</informalexample>

<informalexample>
<literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la djiotis. xajmi semu'i lenu so'i prenu cu nelci dy</foreignphrase>
Jyoti is-funny with-motivated-result the-event many people like her
Jyoti is funny, so many people like her.
</literallayout>
</informalexample>

</para>

<para>Now, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">lenu</foreignphrase>-abstractions can be treated as
sentences: they contain complete <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase>, after all. So we can also phrase
these sentences as separate sentences, still using <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti tcita</foreignphrase> to connect them:

<informalexample>
<literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la flufis. mrobi'o .i ni'ibo ro ractu na'e ze'u jmive</foreignphrase>
Fluffy died That's because rabbits don't live long.
</literallayout>
</informalexample>

<informalexample>
<literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ro ractu na'e ze'u jmive .iseni'ibo la flufis. mrobi'o</foreignphrase>
Rabbits don't live long, with the logical consequence that Fluffy died.
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
</para>

<para>There's a new <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase> in the last example, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bo</foreignphrase>. Why? Well, a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti tcita</foreignphrase> can indeed be used to connect sentences to 
other sentences, just as it is used to connect <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> into <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase> (even though there are only so many <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti tcita</foreignphrase> this makes sense for &mdash; and this 
lesson contains most of them.) <emphasis>However</emphasis>, left on its own, a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti tcita</foreignphrase> applies to the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> after it. So had I just said

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.iseni'i la flufis. mrobi'o
</foreignphrase></para></informalexample>

that would have meant something like <quote>With the logical result of 
Fluffy, [something] dies.</quote> I'm not quite sure what this 
means; maybe the <quote role="socalled">something</quote> is some mythical 
creature that spontaneously generates bunny rabbits when it dies. But of 
course, this doesn't mean what we want. To make the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti tcita</foreignphrase> apply to the 
<emphasis>entire</emphasis> sentence, we follow it with the word <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bo</foreignphrase>.</para>

<note><para>This applies to other kind of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti tcita</foreignphrase>, by the way; for example,
tense words. For example, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i ba
bo</foreignphrase> means <quote role="gloss">afterwards, then</quote>: the
sentence it introduces comes after the one before it. </para></note>

<note><para>The very astute reader will have noted that <quote
role="gloss">afterwards</quote> <emphasis>should</emphasis> have been
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i pu bo</foreignphrase>; the analogy with
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ba ku</foreignphrase> won out, though. The
rest of you can ponder what on Earth I'm talking about, but need not lose
over sleep over it.</para></note>






<simplesect role="exercise"><title>Exercise 2.</title>

<para>This is just like Exercise 1, except that now we have eight choices:

</sect1>

<sect1 id="less10why"><title>Why?</title>

<para>With four types of <wordasword>because</wordasword>, we can now make four types
of <wordasword>why</wordasword>, simply by using <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ma</foreignphrase>. Our child's questions from the 
beginning of the lesson translate as follows:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">carvi ri'a ma</foreignphrase></para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la salis. darxi mi mu'i ma</foreignphrase></para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la salis. te dunda lo tartcita le ctuca ki'u ma</foreignphrase></para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la flufis. pu mrobi'o ni'i ma</foreignphrase></para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>Of course, the questions do not have to take these forms; if young
Joey is a religious type, he might say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la flufis.
pu mrobi'o ki'u ma</foreignphrase>, asking with what justification God took
his rabbit from him, whereas if he is scientifically minded, he might ask
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la flufis. pu mrobi'o ri'a ma</foreignphrase>,
inquiring as to the physical cause of Fluffy's death. </para>

<para>To an English-speaker, this looks back-to-front (<quote>It rains.
Why?</quote>) but there is really no reason why question-words have to come
at the beginning of a sentence. However, if you prefer to start with
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ma</foreignphrase>, you can always use the
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase>, e.g.

<informalexample>
<literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ma rinka lenu carvi</foreignphrase>
what? physically-causes the-event rain
</literallayout>
</informalexample>

And since the position of <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti 
tcita</foreignphrase> in the <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase> is fairly free, nothing is preventing you 
from saying

<informalexample>
<para>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ri'a ma carvi</foreignphrase>
</para>
</informalexample>

</para>

<para>Answers to <wordasword>why</wordasword>-questions are usually not a whole
sentence but an event abstraction-<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>, 
following Lojban's fill-in-the-slot approach to questions and answers; e.g.

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la salis. darxi mi mu'i ma</foreignphrase></para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lenu do lacpu lei kerfa</foreignphrase></para></listitem>

This is short for the long-winded <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lenu do lacpu

<para>Translate from Lojban.</para>

<note><para>On occasion, it is useful to give bits of non-Lojban in a
Lojban text, without adjusting it to the Lojban interpretation of the
alphabet. This could be because we don't want to distort a name too much by
<quote role="socalled">Lojbanising</quote> it, or because we're actually
inserting a phrase from another language into the language. In both cases,
we have to give an unambiguous signal where the non-Lojban text finishes.
To do this, non-Lojban is surrounded on either side by a Lojban word
&mdash; any word, as long as it doesn't occur inside the non-Lojban text.
The most popular choice is <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gy</foreignphrase>,
standing for <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">glico</foreignphrase> <quote
role="gloss">English</quote> (since that's where most non-Lojban text comes
from.)</para><para>If the text is a name, it is preceded by <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">la'o</foreignphrase> instead of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">la</foreignphrase>. If it is a quotation, it is preceded by
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">zoi</foreignphrase> instead of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">lu ... li'u</foreignphrase>.</para></note>
