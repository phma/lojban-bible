<chapter id="less13"><title>Keeping it flowing: Textual <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase></title>

<para>Most of what we've been concentrating on until now has had to do with
the logical side of Lojban &mdash; getting sentences to be true. To that
end, we've been looking at how to describe relationships between things
(<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase>, internal
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>); how to situate
events and things in time and space; how to describe things as masses or
individuals; how to speak about events and facts; and so on. </para>

<para>This kind of thing is the <quote role="socalled">hard-core</quote> of
Lojban, so to speak; the logical machinery on which Lojban is based, and
which works with concrete realities. But there's another, less concrete
side to language. No, not its ineffable soul, or its intrinsic poetry, or
anything like that: we're not about to go into such giddy heights.
(Although those giddy heights do have some rather tangible &mdash; and
linguistically concrete &mdash; bases.) The less concrete side of language 
has to do, not with what you say about things, but how you manage the 
business of saying it. This means things like how you express your 
attitudes to things; how 
you put the things you talk about in the foreground or the background; how 
you deal with misunderstandings and errors; and how you structure your 
texts.</para>

<para>A language isn't really a language if it can't cope with things like
these &mdash; although typically these kinds of things are not dealt with
in traditional grammars, but are picked up in usage. If there's one thing
you'll have noticed about Lojban, of course, it's that it's as explicitly
specified as possible. Accordingly, Lojban has a special subsection of
its grammar dealing with this kind of thing, rather than leaving it up to
usage. But, precisely because this kind of thing isn't what logic was
designed for, the grammar Lojban uses has little to do with <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase>: it is a much simpler grammar,
mostly using isolated words. We'll go through the ones you're likeliest to
meet here.</para>

<sect1 id="less13attit"><title>Lojban with lots more attitude</title>

<para>You'll remember from way back in <link linkend="less1">Lesson 
1</link> that Lojban has little words called <wordasword>attitudinal 
indicators</wordasword> (or <wordasword>attitudinals</wordasword>), which 
show how you feel about something. That something is whatever the 
attitudinal follows; as we have seen, if it is next to a terminator, it's 
a reaction to whatever phrase ends in the terminator. If it follows an 
article, then it applies to the entire <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>; if it follows a connective, it 
applies to the connective and whatever following term is is connecting; and 
so on.</para>

<para>Attitudinals belong to the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase> (<foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">se cmavo</foreignphrase>, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase> class) UI. This means that their 
grammar is as simple as can be: they can turn up after just about any word 
of Lojban, without disrupting anything going on grammatically. For that 
reason, they don't need terminators: there's no danger of them swallowing 
up any errant <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>.</para>

<para>There are some <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase>
whose job is to modify other UI <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase>, though. You've seen one already:
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">nai</foreignphrase> has the function of
converting the attitudinal expressed to its opposite. So if <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.a'u</foreignphrase> expresses interest, its opposite,
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.a'unai</foreignphrase>, expresses
repulsion. We saw in our discussion of <link
linkend="less6">negations</link> that, when you set up a scale between
something and its opposite (<foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">to'e</foreignphrase>), you can also speak of something
that's neutral, in-between (<foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">no'e</foreignphrase>). The same goes for attitudinals,
and the word to use in that case is <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cu'i</foreignphrase>. So <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.a'ucu'i</foreignphrase> expresses neither interest nor
repulsion, but disinterest.</para>

<para>You can divide up the continuum even more finely. If you want to say
that you feel an emotion only weakly, you can add to it <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ru'e</foreignphrase>. If you want to say you feel it
strongly, you can add <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sai</foreignphrase>.
And if you want to say you feel it <emphasis>really</emphasis> strongly,
you add <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cai</foreignphrase>. This gives
you a seven-part scale:

<informalexample><literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cai &gt; sai &gt;</foreignphrase> (nothing) <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">&gt; ru'e  &gt; cu'i &gt; nairu'e &gt; nai &gt; naisai &gt; naicai</foreignphrase></literallayout>
</informalexample>

So for instance, if you want to
say <quote>Eh. That's cool</quote>, you'd say <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.a'ucu'i</foreignphrase>. If you want to say <quote>That
is really gross!</quote>, you'd say <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.a'unaisai</foreignphrase>. And if you want to say
<quote>Oh my God, that is the most interesting thing in the world since the
very invention of Lojban!</quote>, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.a'ucai</foreignphrase> is a pretty safe bet. (All these
modifiers belong to <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase> CAI, except for <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">nai</foreignphrase> &mdash; which turns up all over
Lojban grammar, as we've already seen, and has its own <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase>, NAI.)</para>

<para>There are 39 attitudinals fitting the pattern VV (two vowels,
possibly with an apostrophe between them; these are a subclass of
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase>, called UI1.) Each
of these corresponds to a different emotional state. With the addition of
the seven-way scale we've just described, that makes 273 attitudinals you
can use, plunking them pretty much wherever you want in your sentence.
That's not even counting <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase> UI4 and UI5, which can further
modify your attitudes. As with everything else, Lojban allows you to be as
specific as you want in expressing yourself.</para>

<note><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase> UI4
specifies what <quote role="socalled">part</quote> of you is feeling the
emotion &mdash; whether it is a physical, social, mental response, and so
on. <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase> UI5 has some
<quote role="socalled">left-over</quote> modifiers; we already saw in
passing <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ga'i</foreignphrase>, which
indicates haughtiness. The <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase> in this category you will see
almost constantly is <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">zo'o</foreignphrase>.
It is used just like the smiley-face in e-mail, to indicate that you're
being humorous when saying something, and it's used for much the same
reason. In these two communication systems, it's difficult to work out whether 
someone is joking or not &mdash; in e-mail, because you can't hear the tone of voice 
that gives things away; in Lojban, because by its ideology the language doesn't 
want to leave things to natural-language&ndash;based intuition. So hints 
like this are always welcome, and frequently taken advantage of.</para></note>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="less13attmine"><title>My attitudinals! All mine! (And you?)</title>

<para>A common pitfall to avoid is trying to specify whose attitude the
attitudinals express. The reason UI <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase> are so simple is that they express
direct emotional responses &mdash; gut reactions, without making any fine
distinctions like whose attitude is involved. The reaction is always taken
to be the speaker's. So <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.ui do
cliva</foreignphrase> means <emphasis>you</emphasis>'re happy that someone
else is leaving, just like <quote>You're leaving &mdash; Yay!</quote> If
you wanted to say that the <quote role="socalled">someone else</quote> is
happy, not you, then you wouldn't say <wordasword>Yay!</wordasword> at all,
but <quote>You must be happy you're leaving.</quote> The same goes in
Lojban: if you're relaying someone else's responses, not your own, then
that's what <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase> are
there for.</para>

<para>You wouldn't likely make this mistake for <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.ui</foreignphrase>; but there are other <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase> it's almost impossible not to do
this with. The worst offender is probably <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.ei</foreignphrase>, which expresses obligation.
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.ei mi cliva</foreignphrase> means
<quote>I ought to leave.</quote> But <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.ei
do cliva</foreignphrase> doesn't necessarily mean <quote>You ought to
leave.</quote> It's more like <quote>I feel the obligation for you to
leave</quote>: I can say this if I want you gone while you're making 
yourself comfortable &mdash; but not if you've remembered you've got to be 
somewhere else, while I'd want nothing more than for you to stick around.</para>

<note><para>The temptation is strong enough, in fact, that there are a
couple of ways of getting around it. If you add the UI5 <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase> <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">se'i</foreignphrase>, you say that you feel the emotion
for yourself. If you add <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">se'inai</foreignphrase>, then, you say that you feel it
for someone else: <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.uise'inai</foreignphrase> is pretty much <quote>I'm
happy for you!</quote> And if you add <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">dai</foreignphrase>, you're saying that the emotion is
someone else's, and that you are empathising with them. If <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.a'u</foreignphrase> is <quote>That's
interesting!</quote>, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.a'udai</foreignphrase> is more like <quote>That must
have been interesting for you!</quote></para></note>

<para>One final thing: if you want to know how someone feels about
something, once again Lojban provides a fill-in-the-slot question word. The
word asking the listener to fill in the attitudinal that best applies is
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">pei</foreignphrase>. You can fill
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">pei</foreignphrase> in with anything from
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase> UI, NAI or CAI. So
if I ask you <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i pei le lunra cu
blanu</foreignphrase> <quote>The moon is blue &mdash; how do you feel about
that?</quote>, at least one response is <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.ienai</foreignphrase> <quote>Disagree!</quote>
(<quote>Uh-uh</quote>, <quote>No way!</quote>, <quote>No!</quote>, etc.)
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">pei</foreignphrase> can also explicitly
ask for NAI or CAI alone, by following a UI <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase>. So a response to <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.i .u'ipei do farlu le pesxu</foreignphrase> <quote>You
fell into the mud! Funny, eh?</quote> could well be <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ru'e</foreignphrase>: <quote>Kinda...</quote> Then again,
it could also be <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">naicai</foreignphrase>:
<quote>Absolutely not, and I shall thank you never again to mention it in
my presence.</quote> (Allowing for some latitude in translation...)</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="less13disc"><title>Discursives</title>

<para>Attitude isn't the only meaning UI <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase> convey. Another subclass of UI <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase> (UI3: discursives) carry 
information about how a particular word or phrase fits in with everything 
else you're saying.</para>

<para>We've seen one such <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase> already: <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ku'i</foreignphrase>, which means <quote
role="gloss">but, however</quote>. This means that whatever it is attached
to contrasts with what you've been saying. It usually applies to a whole
sentence (so normally you'll see it next to <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.i</foreignphrase>), but it can apply to a single word:
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.abu na.e <emphasis>ku'i</emphasis>
by.</foreignphrase> is the proper Lojban for <quote>Not A,
<emphasis>but</emphasis> B.</quote></para>

<para>The flipside to <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ku'i</foreignphrase>
is <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ji'a</foreignphrase> <quote
role="gloss">additionally, also</quote> (which we saw in passing last
lesson.) This means that whatever it is attached to adds on to what you've
been saying. Again, this can apply to individual words, as well as
sentences: <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i mi venfu do doi melbi .e
<emphasis>ji'a</emphasis> le do cmalu gerku</foreignphrase> is the Lojban
for <quote>I'll get you, my pretty &mdash; and your little dog,
<emphasis>too</emphasis>!</quote></para>

<para>In some cases, there is nothing to either contrast or add to what
you've said, because what you've said is the unique relevant case. In that
context, you would use <wordasword>only</wordasword> in English. Because
<wordasword>only</wordasword> is somewhat clumsy to express in terms of
pure logic, Lojban allows another discursive as its equivalent:
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">po'o</foreignphrase>. So <quote>Only cats
like catnip</quote> is in Lojban <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">loi mlatu
po'o cu nelci loi spati be la'o ly. Nepeta cataria ly.</foreignphrase>
(<citetitle>Nepeta cataria</citetitle> being the Linnaean name for catnip.)
If you wanted to say that something is <emphasis>not</emphasis> the only
applicable case, then of course you'd say <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">po'onai</foreignphrase>.</para>

<para>There are several more discursives, but because written English 
doesn't particularly insist on them, you won't seem them all that often. 
Some to watch out for, though, include:

</variablelist>

</para>

<para>There are two more UI <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase> that will come in handy. <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">da'i</foreignphrase> means <quote 
role="gloss">hypothetically</quote>; it points out that what you are saying 
is a hypothesis, rather than fact. This is how you distinguish 
between hypothetical and non-hypothetical kinds of 
<wordasword>if</wordasword>:

<informalexample>
<literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i <emphasis>da'i</emphasis> do zvati le nu la rikis.martin. tigni .inaja do tirna la'o sy. La Vida Loca sy.</foreignphrase>
If you <emphasis>had</emphasis> gone to the Ricky Martin concert, then you <emphasis>would have</emphasis> heard <citetitle>La Vida Loca</citetitle>.

</informalexample>

<informalexample>
<literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i <emphasis>da'inai</emphasis> do zvati le nu la rikis.martin. tigni .inaja do tirna la'o sy. La Vida Loca sy.</foreignphrase>
If you <emphasis>did</emphasis> go to the Ricky Martin concert, then you <emphasis>must have</emphasis> heard <citetitle>La Vida Loca</citetitle>.
</literallayout>
</informalexample>

</para>

<para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ki'a</foreignphrase>, finally, is a
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase> you want to make
your friend. <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ki'a</foreignphrase> is
Lojban for <quote role="gloss">Huh?</quote> When you don't understand what 
someone has just said &mdash; whether because you don't get what they were 
referring to, or you don't know the word, or the grammar confused you &mdash; 
you repeat the word or phrase you didn't get, and add <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">ki'a</foreignphrase> as a plaintive request for 
clarification (so it's even better than <wordasword>Huh?</wordasword>, 
because you can identify exactly what made you say <wordasword>Huh?</wordasword>):

<informalexample>
<literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i mi puzi te vencu lo matcrflokati
.i matcrflokati ki'a</foreignphrase>
<quote>I just bought a <foreignphrase lang="ell">flokati</foreignphrase> [rug].</quote>

</para>
</simplesect>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="less13erase"><title>Erasure</title>

<para>When you make a mistake while speaking, whether in your wording or
your grammar, you don't normally bother to correct it (if you even realise
you made a mistake in the first place.) That's because natural languages 
are fairly redundant (for this reason!); and we normally rely a lot more 
on context than on what we actually hear, anyway. If we do catch ourselves 
making an error, we stumble out a correction that will do the trick, 
without going into details like how many words should be cancelled: again, 
context is almost always more than adequate. So if I say
<informalexample>
<para>I downloaded and learned some Esperanto vocabulary. Er, Lojban vocabulary.</para> 
</informalexample>
context and common sense would dictate that <wordasword>Lojban
vocabulary</wordasword> is meant to replace <wordasword>Esperanto
vocabulary</wordasword>. But what if it was meant to replace
<wordasword>some Esperanto vocabulary</wordasword>? Or
<wordasword>downloaded and learned some Esperanto vocabulary</wordasword>? We 
wouldn't normally care, in natural languages.
</para>

<para>But Lojban is Lojban precisely because it is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
a natural language. And this kind of imprecision does not sit well with 
how the language was designed. So Lojban allows you to be more precise 
about what words you are correcting. Whether it is actually too be precise 
to be useful &mdash; well, that's something for usage to determine. But the 
tools are available, if you want them.</para>

<para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">si</foreignphrase> erases the 
immediately preceding word. If you want to erase two words in a row, you 
say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">si si</foreignphrase> after them. So 
the correction above would be in Lojban 

<informalexample>
<para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i mi te benji je cilre loi 
bangrnesperanto valsi si si lojbo valsi</foreignphrase>.</para>
</informalexample>
</para>

<para>The problem with <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">si</foreignphrase>
is, you have to count words. This can get tedious, and you shouldn't have
to keep a transcript of your words when you want to correct yourself. The
other correction word Lojban offers is somewhat more helpful:
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sa</foreignphrase> erases a phrase, and
doesn't have to be right next to the phrase it erases. It works by taking
the word following it, which starts the phrase to serve as the correction.
It then goes back in the sentence, looking for the last time you used a
phrase starting with the same word. (Same <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase>, actually.) Once it finds the 
last such phrase, it replaces it with the phrase following <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">sa</foreignphrase>. For example:

<informalexample>
<para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i mi te benji je cilre loi 
sa .i mi cilre loi lojbo</foreignphrase>.</para>
</informalexample>

The correction following <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sa</foreignphrase> is a sentence; you know that, because
the first word after <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sa</foreignphrase> is
the sentence marker, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i</foreignphrase>.
So the sentence following <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sa</foreignphrase> replaces the current sentence up to
and including <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sa</foreignphrase>:
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i mi te benji je cilre loi
sa</foreignphrase>. Or take:

<informalexample>
<para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i ca le purlamdei mi mrilu fi do sa ca 
la reldjed.</foreignphrase>.</para>
</informalexample>

The correction is <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ca la
reldjed.</foreignphrase> <quote role="gloss">on Monday</quote>. So what it 
replaces is the last phrase beginning with <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">ca</foreignphrase>: <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ca 
le purlamdei</foreignphrase> <quote role="gloss">yesterday</quote>. The 
English version would be <quote>Yesterday I mailed you... actually, it was 
Monday.</quote>
</para>

<para>Inevitably with textual <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase>, there's a lot of words that can
only be called odds and ends; they each have a specific little job, and don't
have much in common. <citetitle>The Complete Lojban Language</citetitle>,
Chapter 19, bemoans the same problem. </para>

<para>To survive in Lojbanistan, though, you'll certainly need the following:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ni'o</foreignphrase>
begins a new paragraph. Paragraphs are usually associated with new topics,
and <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ni'o</foreignphrase> is meant to
remind you of <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cnino</foreignphrase> <quote
role="gloss">new</quote>. There's some complicated stuff about what happens
with tenses and assigned pro-<foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> across different types of
paragraph, but you can do without that for now.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>To emphasise a word, where you would use stress in a spoken
natural language, and italics or capitals in a written language, Lojban
insists (as should be no surprise to you by now) that you use a separate
word: <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ba'e</foreignphrase>. Like UI, this
word can go pretty much anywhere in a Lojban sentence, but it emphasises
the word that <emphasis>follows</emphasis> it, rather than what precedes
it. (Or, to put it in Lojban, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">zo ba'e
basna le valsi poi se lidne ku'o .enai le lidne be zo
ba'e</foreignphrase>.)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">zo ki'a</foreignphrase>, I
hear you ask? Good, that means you've been paying attention! <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">zo</foreignphrase> is a quotation marker, just like
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lu</foreignphrase>. However,
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">zo</foreignphrase> quotes
<emphasis>only</emphasis> the word immediately after it. This means it does
not need a terminator: we already know where the quotation ends. The saving
in two syllables is highly valued in a language which can get as prolix as
Lojban does.</para>

<note><para>Since <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">zo</foreignphrase>
quotes any word following it &mdash; <emphasis>any</emphasis> word &mdash;
it turns out that <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">zo ki'a</foreignphrase>
doesn't mean <quote><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">zo</foreignphrase>?
Huh?</quote> at all, but <quote>The word <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ki'a</foreignphrase>.</quote> To ask
<quote><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">zo</foreignphrase>? Huh?</quote>,
you'll have to resort to (wait for it) <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">zo
zo ki'a</foreignphrase>.</para></note> </listitem>

<listitem><para>Parenthetical remarks can go anywhere UI can &mdash;
meaning pretty much anywhere in a Lojban sentence. With parentheses, just
like with quotes, you need to know where the parenthesis starts, and where
it ends. And just like quotes, the end-parenthesis terminator is going to
be pretty hard to drop out. The normal Lojban parentheses are
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">to</foreignphrase> and <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">toi</foreignphrase>. So <quote>This (no, I don't want
another one!) apple is rotten</quote> comes out in Lojban as <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ti poi <emphasis>to vi'onai do'u mi na djica lo drata
toi</emphasis> plise cu fusra</foreignphrase>.</para></listitem>
