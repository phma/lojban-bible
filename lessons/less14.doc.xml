<chapter id="less14"><title>Why didn't I think of that before? More 
connectives</title><titleabbrev>Why didn't I think of that before?</titleabbrev>

<para>We have already seen in <link linkend="less11">Lesson 11</link> 
several Lojban connectives described. This lesson rounds off discussion of 
connectives, with three additional types. First, we consider forethought 
connectives: these are used to identify the logical relation between two 
terms in front of the first term, rather than in between the two. Then, 
we look at some more non-logical connectives &mdash; which may prove more 
useful than you might have expected, especially in a <quote 
role="socalled">logical</quote> language. Finally, we look at connectives 
used to structure <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">tanru</foreignphrase> 
&mdash; in particular, how to group <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> together within <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">tanru</foreignphrase>.
</para>

<sect1 id="less14fore"><title>Forethought connectives</title>

<para>As we've already seen, there are some things odd about the Lojban 
logical connective for IF. One oddity we haven't touched upon is that you 
realise that there's a conditional going on only halfway through. Recall 
what a typical instance of IF looks like:

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i mi djuno ledu'u do
vi zvati .inaja mi dasni noda</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>You read the first sentence, and everything goes swimmingly: 
<quote>I know that you're here.</quote> Then, shazam! you get the 
connective: <quote>IF that were the case, I would wear nothing.</quote> You 
didn't know in advance that the first sentence was going to be an IF. This 
is unlike the case in English (and natural languages in general), where 
the <wordasword>if</wordasword> comes right at the start of the first 
sentence, and gives you plenty of warning about what's coming up.</para>

<para>The problem here is, the logical version of IF 
<emphasis>denies</emphasis> what comes before it. So in effect, you're 
getting the first statement, all nice and easy, and then the surprise: 
<quote>Either <emphasis>that</emphasis>'s not true, or 
<emphasis>this</emphasis> is true.</quote> Things are just as bad for 
other connectives denying what comes before them. For instance, <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">na.e</foreignphrase> is a perfectly reasonable 
connective: <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">mi djica loi bakni na.e loi jipci</foreignphrase> 
<quote>I want not the beef, but the chicken.</quote> But look at what the 
Lojban is actually saying: <quote>I want the beef &mdash; NOT! and the 
chicken.</quote> There was a vogue in the '90s of putting NOT! at the end 
of sentences in American English (see <citetitle>Wayne's 
World</citetitle>.) This was a joke, and the reason it was a joke was that 
saying a sentence isn't true <emphasis>after you've already said 
it</emphasis> isn't exactly being helpful.
</para>

<para>So if we're going to use logical connectives in Lojban, and are 
obligated to pull NOT!-tricks like this, the Lojban listener can 
understandably get frustrated. Lojban has an answer, though (as usual). 
With forethought connectives, you can state the logical relationship 
between two terms <emphasis>in front of</emphasis> the first term. You 
still need a word between the two terms, to indicate that they're being 
logically connected; but now you know in advance what that logical 
connection is.
</para>

<para>If <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> are
involved, the forethought connective is formed by placing <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">g</foreignphrase> in front of the vowel indicating the
logical relationship. The two <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> are then connected with the
leftover <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">g</foreignphrase>-word,
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gi</foreignphrase>. So the forethought
version of <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi .e do</foreignphrase> is
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ge mi gi do</foreignphrase>. Here,
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ge</foreignphrase> means that the two
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> coming up are
connected with AND, while <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">gi</foreignphrase> indicates that what follows is the
second <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> in the
relation. (These forethought connectives belong to <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase> GA.)</para>

<para>The real usefulness of these forms comes out in the NOT!-connectives
we've just seen. If you want to give some warning when choosing the chicken
instead of the beef, you can now say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi
djica <emphasis>genai</emphasis> loi bakni <emphasis>gi</emphasis> loi jipci</foreignphrase>. (Forethought
connectives can followed by <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">nai</foreignphrase>, just like their afterthought
counterparts.) If you wanted to say <quote>beef, not chicken</quote>, you
would put <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">nai</foreignphrase> after the
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gi</foreignphrase>: <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mi djica ge loi bakni ginai loi
jipci</foreignphrase>.</para>

<para>If you're connecting <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase>, as it turns out, you still use <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase> GA. If you don't follow GA + <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> immediately by <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">gi</foreignphrase> and another <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>, then Lojban grammar assumes that 
you're connecting not <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> any more, but <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase>. So our forethought version of 
Zhang's statement of wishful thinking is:

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i <emphasis>ganai</emphasis> mi djuno lenu do
vi zvati <emphasis>gi</emphasis> mi dasni noda</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>You'll notice that there is no second <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">.i</foreignphrase> here. Two <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase> connected by GA belong to the same 
sentence; we already know from the grammar that what's coming up after the <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">gi</foreignphrase> is a separate <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase>, so we don't need to separate it 
out with <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">.i</foreignphrase>. 
</para>

<note><para>This can actually turn out handy in beating Lojban precedence.
For example, remember in <link linkend="less10">Lesson 10</link> that we 
gave two sentences, and their logical conclusion:

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i la flufis. ractu .ije ro ractu na'e ze'u jmive .i la flufis. seni'i na ze'u jmive
</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>We should be able from that to say 

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">
<emphasis>.i</emphasis> la flufis. ractu <emphasis>.ije</emphasis> ro ractu
na'e ze'u jmive <emphasis>.iseni'ibo</emphasis> la flufis. na ze'u jmive
</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>right? Actually, no we can't: <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">bo</foreignphrase> has the function of 
connecting sentences through <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">sumti tcita</foreignphrase>, because it connects sentences 
on its own. And when it does, it connects them tighter than <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">.ije</foreignphrase> does. This means that <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">.iseni'ibo</foreignphrase> connects only to the 
immediately preceding sentence &mdash; not to the preceding sentence pair! 
So Fluffy's death is presented as a consequence of rabbits' not living 
long &mdash; not a consequence of <emphasis>both</emphasis> rabbits' not 
living long <emphasis>and</emphasis> Fluffy being a rabbit.</para>

<para>However, if we put the two <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase> in a single sentence, then none of 
this is an issue: the conclusion will attach to both <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase>, in a single sentence:

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i
<emphasis>ge</emphasis> la flufis. ractu <emphasis>gi</emphasis> ro ractu
na'e ze'u jmive <emphasis>.iseni'ibo</emphasis> la flufis. na ze'u jmive</foreignphrase></para></informalexample></para></note>

<para>There is also a forethought connective for <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">tanru</foreignphrase>, corresponding to JA: these are the 
connectives belonging to <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase> GUhA,
and are formed by placing <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">gu'</foreignphrase> in front of the connective vowel
(connecting the second <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">tanru</foreignphrase> with <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">gu'i</foreignphrase>.) So if we want to say that Susan
fancies men that are, if funny, then also handsome, the afterthought
version is

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la suzyn. cinynei 
ro melbi naja xajmi nanmu
</foreignphrase></para>

</informalexample>To make this slightly (but only slightly!) more comprehensible, we can put 
this in forethought mode:

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la suzyn. cinynei 
ro <emphasis>gu'anai</emphasis> melbi <emphasis>gu'i</emphasis> xajmi nanmu
</foreignphrase></para></informalexample></para>

<para>There are no forethought versions of <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase>-tail connectives. In practice, 
however, two <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase> connected by GA can be <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase>-tails just as easily as full <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase>: there is no real meaning 
distinction between the two.</para>

<sect1 id="less14nonlog"><title>Non-logical connectives</title>

<para>We have already seen one non-logical connective, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">joi</foreignphrase>. By non-logical, we mean that the
truth of the combined terms does not depend on the truth of the individual
components. It may not be true that <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la
kris. bevri le pipno</foreignphrase> <quote>Chris carries the
piano</quote>, or <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la pat. bevri le
pipno</foreignphrase> <quote>Pat carries the piano</quote>, for example (to
revisit an example from <link linkend="less4">Lesson 4</link>), even if
it is true that <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la kris. joi la pat. bevri
le pipno</foreignphrase> <quote>Chris and Pat carry the
piano.</quote></para>

<para>Lojban has several other non-logical connectives; we'll cover the 
most frequently used ones here:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ce</foreignphrase> joins
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> (usually) into a
set, rather than a mass like <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">joi</foreignphrase>.</para>

<para>We haven't said much about sets; and because sets are fairly abstract
entities, as entities go, you don't often have occasion to talk about them.
While you can say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi viska loi
remna</foreignphrase> <quote>I saw a mass of people</quote>, for example
(you saw them as a bunch), you aren't likely to say <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mi viska lo'i remna</foreignphrase> <quote>I saw a set of 
people.</quote></para>

<para>But as we have seen in the exercises, some <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> need sets in order to work.
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">simxu</foreignphrase>, for example, takes
as its x<subscript>1</subscript> a set. This is because the group of things or people in a mutual
relationship needs to be well-defined: you've got to be able to say with certainty whether
someone is involved in the relationship or not. The point of sets is that
you can categorically say <wordasword>x</wordasword> belongs to the set or doesn't. The
membership of masses is left much more nebulous, so saying <quote>a bunch
of people talk to each other</quote> doesn't make as definite a statement.
The same goes for <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cuxna</foreignphrase>
<quote role="gloss">choose</quote>: what you choose from in Lojban (x<subscript>3</subscript>) is
a set, because you normally have to be certain what belongs in the group 
you're choosing from, and what doesn't.</para>

<para>So when you form a set out of several <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>, you connect them with
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ce</foreignphrase>. To say <quote>Jyoti,
Susan and Ranjeet talk to each other</quote>, you would say something like
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la djiotis. ce la suzyn. ce la ranjit.
simxu lenu tavla soivo'a</foreignphrase>, or <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">la djiotis. ce la suzyn. ce la ranjit. tavla
simxu</foreignphrase>. Similarly, if you pick one of Jyoti, Susan or
Ranjeet, you would say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi cuxna pa da la
djiotis. ce la suzyn. ce la ranjit.</foreignphrase></para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If you are referring to an ordered set &mdash; a sequence
of things, in other words &mdash; then you use <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ce'o</foreignphrase> to place things in order. This gets
invoked when you're compiling a list for whatever reason; for example, the
Lojban alphabet is a sequence, and you'd list it as <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.abu ce'o by. ce'o cy. ce'o dy. ce'o .ebu
...</foreignphrase> and so on. This is what <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">liste</foreignphrase> <quote role="gloss">list</quote>
and <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">porsi</foreignphrase>
<quote role="gloss">sequence</quote> expect as their x<subscript>1</subscript> <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">fa'u</foreignphrase>
carries the meaning of <wordasword>respectively</wordasword>: it relates pairs of
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> cross-wise. If I
were to say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la suzyn. .e la djiotis. tavla
la jan. .e la ranjit.</foreignphrase>, that means that both Susan and
Jyoti talk to both Zhang and Ranjeet. If I want to say that Susan only
talked to Zhang, and Jyoti only to Ranjeet (i.e. <quote>Susan and Jyoti
talked to Zhang and Ranjeet, <emphasis>respectively</emphasis></quote>), a
logical connective is not useful. Instead, I would use <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fa'u</foreignphrase> to connect both pairs of
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>: <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">la suzyn. fa'u la djiotis. tavla la jan. fa'u la
ranjit.</foreignphrase> <quote>Susan, cross-wise with Jyoti, talks to 
Zhang, cross-wise with Ranjeet.</quote></para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If you're talking about a range, you use <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bi'i</foreignphrase> to describe the range between the
first thing and the second thing; so it corresponds to English
<wordasword>between</wordasword>. If you want to say <quote>I dropped my
pencil somewhere between the office and the bar</quote>, you would describe
the location <quote>somewhere between the office and the bar</quote> as
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le briju ku bi'i le barja</foreignphrase>.
The whole
sentence would come out as <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi falcru lemi
pinsi <emphasis>vi le briju ku bi'i le barja</emphasis></foreignphrase></para>

<warning><para>This <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase>, BIhI, like
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase> JOI to
which all non-logical connectives belong, can join both <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> and <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>. So Lojban grammar requires you to
terminate a <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> before
JOI with <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">ku</foreignphrase>.</para></warning>

</listitem>

<listitem><para>If the order of the things defining the range matters, you
use <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">bi'o</foreignphrase>. This corresponds
to <wordasword>from... to...</wordasword> in English (though
<wordasword>between</wordasword> covers both ordered and unordered
intervals.) For example, <quote>from 1 pm to 2 pm</quote> is an interval
lasting an hour; but <quote>from 2 pm to 1 pm</quote> would normally be
interpreted as a 23-hour interval (1 pm the following day), since times in
English are assumed to be presented in order. Lojban follows suit with
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">li pavo bi'o li paci
pare</foreignphrase> is a 23-hour interval. If I said <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">li pavo bi'i li paci</foreignphrase>, the order of the two times
would not matter at all; so I could still be talking about a one-hour
interval instead. </para></listitem>

</itemizedlist></para>

<note><para>You can use non-logical connectives in forethought mode, too: 
the forethought connective is the non-logical connective followed by <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">gi</foreignphrase>. So the forethought version of <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">la kris. joi la pat.</foreignphrase> is <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">joi gi la kris. gi la pat.</foreignphrase></para></note>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="less14tanru"><title><foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">tanru</foreignphrase> grouping</title>

<para>The default grouping in Lojban is leftwards. This means that, if you 
have three things connected together in Lojban, the first two go together 
before you join in the third. For example, <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">la djiotis. .e la suzyn. .onai la ranjit</foreignphrase> 
means not <quote>Jyoti and either Susan or Ranjeet</quote>, but 
<quote>Either Jyoti and Susan, or Ranjeet.</quote>
</para>

<para>Does the distinction matter? Depends on your background; programmers, 
for example, are often driven to distraction in making sure their logical 
connectives work out in the right order (usually by copious use of 
brackets.) And there is often a real difference in meaning; the first 
interpretation given above describes a couple, for example, but the second 
doesn't.</para>

<para>The grouping of terms in Lojban grammar is particularly important
when it comes to <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">tanru</foreignphrase>.
The way <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> group
together in a <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">tanru</foreignphrase>
determines what that <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">tanru</foreignphrase>
means. For example, <wordasword>bad music magazine</wordasword> has in
English two interpretations: a bad magazine about music, or a magazine
about bad music. In Lojban, its equivalent <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">xlali zgike karni</foreignphrase> has
<emphasis>only</emphasis> the interpretation <quote role="gloss">magazine
about bad music</quote>, because the first two <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> (<foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">xlali zgike</foreignphrase> <quote role="gloss">bad
music</quote>) group together first. So it is important to be able to
modify the grouping of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase>, so that we can make sure the
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">tanru</foreignphrase> means what we
actually intend it to mean. For that reason, Lojban has a couple of
mechanisms in place for making sure <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">tanru</foreignphrase> group together properly.</para>

<para>If you are a programmer, or a mathematician, you have long ago made
brackets your trusted aide in dealing with this kind of problem. So you won't be
surprised to hear that Lojban has <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase> that act as parentheses, grouping
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> together. Those
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase> are not
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">to</foreignphrase> and <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">toi</foreignphrase>: those are reserved for your own
parenthetical comments, and you never know when you might want to insert a
snide remark in the middle of a particularly arduous <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">tanru</foreignphrase>. Rather, the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase> you need are <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ke</foreignphrase>, to open the grouping bracket, and
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ke'e</foreignphrase>, to close it. So if
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">xlali zgike karni</foreignphrase> means a
<wordasword>{bad music} magazine</wordasword>, then a <wordasword>bad
{music magazine}</wordasword> is in Lojban <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">xlali <emphasis>ke</emphasis> zgike karni
<emphasis>ke'e</emphasis></foreignphrase>.</para>

<para>Now, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ke'e</foreignphrase> is a
terminator, like all the other terminators we've seen: <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ku, kei, ku'o, vau,</foreignphrase> and so on. And like those
terminators, it can be dropped out when no ambiguity will result. So if we
know we're at the end of the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">tanru</foreignphrase>, having reached the end of
the <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> (because we've
just bumped into a <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>,
say, or a new sentence), then we also know that any open <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ke</foreignphrase> brackets must now close; so <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ke'e</foreignphrase> can be omitted. This means
you won't necessarily see a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ke'e</foreignphrase> <quote role="socalled">close
bracket</quote> after each <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ke</foreignphrase> <quote role="socalled">open
bracket</quote>:

<informalexample><literallayout><foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">.i mi pu zi te vecnu lo xlali <emphasis>ke</emphasis> zgike karni .i to'e zanru la'o gy. Eurythmics gy.</foreignphrase>
I just bought a bad {music magazine [}]. It dissed the Eurythmics.</literallayout></informalexample></para>

<para>That's one way of grouping together <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> in <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">tanru</foreignphrase>. The other way is to use a
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase> we've already seen
in a related role: <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">bo</foreignphrase>.
When <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">bo</foreignphrase> appears between
two <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase>, it means that
those <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> group together
more tightly than anything else. So an alternative way of saying
<wordasword>bad {music magazine}</wordasword> is <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">xlali zgike <emphasis>bo</emphasis>
karni</foreignphrase>. This means that <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">zgike bo karni</foreignphrase> should count as a unit, to
which the description <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">xlali</foreignphrase> <quote role="gloss">bad</quote>
applies.</para>

<para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">bo</foreignphrase> does the same job
with sentences (<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i bo</foreignphrase>,
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i ba bo</foreignphrase>, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.i seni'i bo</foreignphrase> all attach to only the
preceding sentence), with connectives (<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.e
bo, gi'e bo</foreignphrase>), and so on. So if I want to say <quote>Jyoti
and either Susan or Ranjeet</quote>, I would say <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">la djiotis. .e la suzyn. .onai<emphasis>bo</emphasis> la
ranjit.</foreignphrase> For that matter, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ke</foreignphrase> can also be used with connectives
(though not with sentences; they have their own kind of bracket,
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">tu'e</foreignphrase>&ndash;<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">tu'u</foreignphrase>.) So I
could also say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la djiotis. .e
<emphasis>ke</emphasis> la suzyn. .onai la ranjit.
<emphasis>ke'e</emphasis></foreignphrase> &mdash; where in most cases the
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ke'e</foreignphrase> may be left out.
(Note that you can't start a run of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> with <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ke</foreignphrase>, for reasons of Lojban grammatical
pedantry we also won't go into here.)</para>

<note><para>An advantage of putting the connective before the two terms, or
after the two terms, is that you can completely avoid this kind of ambiguity. The more
geeky among you will have heard of Reverse Polish notation: this does
arithmetic by placing the operators <emphasis>after</emphasis> the numbers
they operate on (e.g. <computeroutput>(2 + 3) &times; 5</computeroutput> becomes
<computeroutput>2 3 + 5 &times;</computeroutput>), and so avoids having
to use brackets. The same holds for forethought connectives: <quote>Jyoti
and either Susan or Ranjeet</quote> is <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban"><emphasis>ge</emphasis> la djiotis.
<emphasis>gi</emphasis> gonai la suzyn. gi la ranjit.</foreignphrase>, and
<quote>Either Jyoti and Susan, or Ranjeet</quote> is <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban"><emphasis>gonai</emphasis> ge la djiotis.
gi la suzyn. <emphasis>gi</emphasis> la ranjit.</foreignphrase>. Since
there is no ambiguity, you won't need <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bo</foreignphrase> or <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ke</foreignphrase> with forethought
connectives.</para></note>

<simplesect role="exercise"><title>Exercise 2</title>

<para><orderedlist>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ce</foreignphrase>: You are picking a murderer out of a 
group, so the group you are picking from needs to be well-defined. That 
makes it a set.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bi'o</foreignphrase>: The dictionary does not contain 
the letters alpha and delta, of course, but all the Greek dialect words 
between those two letters; so we are dealing with a range. And however slow the 
<citetitle>Academy of Athens</citetitle> has been in getting the volumes 
out (67 years and counting), it has still done them in alphabetical order; so the order of the 
interval matters.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">bi'o</foreignphrase>: This
is still a range, as you are being asked to consult the text contained
<emphasis>between</emphasis> those pages (you will also be looking at page 23.) The pages are
also assumed to be in numerical order, so <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bi'o</foreignphrase> is preferred (although
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">bi'i</foreignphrase> would not be
incorrect: even if you looked through the pages backwards, you would still
end up looking at the same pages.)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ce'o</foreignphrase>: Even
if you don't know what on earth a dactyl and an anapaest is (no, they are
not components of dinosaurs), you can tell from the definition that the
order of short and long syllables makes a difference. So the two terms
involve types of sequences.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ce</foreignphrase>: You are still picking something out 
of a well-defined group, so Lojban uses a set. In fact, all superlatives 
in Lojban (<quote role="gloss">fastest</quote>, <quote role="gloss">smartest</quote>, <quote role="gloss">most likely to dance the funky chicken</quote>) 
involve sets in the same way.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">joi</foreignphrase>: Discussion is a group effort, and 
it does not involve ranges of people or sequences of people. We 
<emphasis>could</emphasis> speak of sets of people involved in discussion, 
if we assumed that you're definitely either in the discussion or out of it; 
but <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">joi</foreignphrase> avoids having to commit to such a 
clearcut distinction.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.e</foreignphrase>: This is a perfectly logical 
connective: what Ranjeet and Zhang do with their shirts, they do 
independently.</para></listitem>

</orderedlist></para>

</simplesect>

<simplesect role="exercise"><title>Exercise 3</title>

<para><orderedlist>

<listitem><para>Zhang is the most purple out of Zhang, Ranjeet, Jyoti and 
Susan. (Literally, <quote>Zhang is superlative in purpleness 
among...</quote> You would normally use a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">lujvo</foreignphrase> &mdash; in this case <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ziryrai</foreignphrase> <quote 
role="gloss">purplest</quote> &mdash; to cut the sentence down to a manageable 
size: <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">la jan. ziryrai la jan. ce la ranjit. ce la djiotis. 
ce la suzyn.</foreignphrase>.)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Also, Zhang is either a better dancer than Ranjeet, or
drunk. (<emphasis>Or</emphasis>: when he's not drunk.) (Literally, again, the Lojban gives more
detail: <quote>Zhang exceeds Ranjeet in the amount by which he is expert
at dancing.</quote> And here, too, you can use a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">lujvo</foreignphrase> to make the sentence somewhat
simpler: <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i la jan.
<emphasis>cremau</emphasis> la ranjit. lenu dansu</foreignphrase>, from
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">certu zmadu</foreignphrase> <quote
role="gloss">more expert</quote>.)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Susan brings Jyoti a beer, and Zhang a soda. (Or soft 
drink, or pop, or coke, or lolly water &mdash; whatever your local word for 
carbonated beverages is.)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Zhang quickly (whether or not willingly) drinks the soda.
(Remember that <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gu'u sutra gu'i
djica</foreignphrase> means the same as <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sutra ju djica</foreignphrase>: it is the willingness, 
rather than the quickness, that is irrelevant.)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Ranjeet says <quote>Don't you think you'll eventually want
some hot, freshly-brewed coffee?</quote> (As the punctuation in the English
shows, the Lojban words for <wordasword>freshly-brewed</wordasword> &mdash;
literally the more prosaic <quote role="gloss">newly constructed</quote>
&mdash; go together. If the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bo</foreignphrase> was not there, Ranjeet would be saying
something like the coffee being novel in that it is hot
(<wordasword>{<emphasis>hot [kind of] new</emphasis>} made
coffee</wordasword>) &mdash; perhaps the establishment doesn't normally
have much of a water heating process, so any actual hot coffee would be a sensation.)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Zhang says <quote>New skin? Huh? My current skin
is head-to-foot beautiful!</quote> (Zhang has misheard Ranjeet over the
thumping music, not to mention the buzz in his own head. As this shows, you can use
non-logical connectives to join together <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> as well as <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>: <wordasword>from head to
toe</wordasword> snuck inside a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">tanru</foreignphrase> is as good a place as any for
it.)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Ranjeet shouts <quote>Coffee!</quote></para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Zhang looks confusedly, and afterwards (then) laughs and 
says <quote>No, silly! I'm drinking soda!</quote> (Ranjeet's exclamation 
can also be interpreted as an observative &mdash; <quote>Look! 
Coffee!</quote>, especially to a mind as addled as Zhang's.)</para>

<note><para>Just like <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">.i</foreignphrase>,
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gi'e</foreignphrase> can be followed by a
tense to indicate when the second term happened relative to the first term.
If <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gi'e</foreignphrase> means <quote
role="gloss">and</quote>, then <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gi'e ba
bo</foreignphrase> means <quote role="gloss">and later</quote>, or <quote
role="gloss">and then</quote>. But <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bo</foreignphrase> still binds immediately to what went
before it. So if we left things as they were, we would be saying something
like <quote>Zhang looks confusedly and then laughs. He also says...</quote>
In that case, we wouldn't necessarily make it clear that he spoke
<emphasis>after</emphasis> he stared, dumbstruck: since logical AND says
nothing about time, that sentence would still be true if Zhang had made his
rather perceptive remark three days earlier. What we want is for the
<wordasword>and later</wordasword> to apply to <emphasis>both</emphasis>
him laughing and him talking. To force this to happen, we use the bracket
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ke</foreignphrase>: <quote>Zhang {stares},
<emphasis>and then</emphasis> {laughs and says <quote>No,
silly...</quote>}</quote></para>

<para>As you may have guessed, we would have avoided having to use brackets 
in forethought mode: <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.i ge la jan. se cfipu catlu gibabo ge cmila gi cusku
