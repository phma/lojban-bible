<para>This lesson is something of a mixed bag. In it, we cover four topics
which are fairly important in Lojban, each of which kind of fits somewhere
else &mdash; but would take us far afield in each of the other lessons.
<firstterm>Aspects</firstterm> are a special kind of <link linkend="less6">tense</link>; <firstterm>vocatives</firstterm>
are a special kind of <link linkend="less13">attitudinal</link>; <firstterm>loan words</firstterm>
are a way of introducing new words into Lojban, comparable to <link
linkend="less8"><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">lujvo</foreignphrase></link>; and <firstterm>equalities</firstterm> involve
a special kind of <link
linkend="less2"><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase></link>.</para>

<sect1 id="less12aspect"><title>Aspect</title>

<para>We've seen that we can locate our <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase> in space and time, by using tenses. 
But this is something of a simplification. We can't just say that events 
are before, simultaneous with, or after other events, because events have 
beginnings, middles and ends. They are not simply points that can be lined 
up on a timeline.
</para>

<para>And we tend to be very interested in the beginnings and ends of
events. There is quite a difference between <quote>Is he about to do his
homework?</quote>, <quote>Is he still doing his homework?</quote>, and
<quote>Has he done his homework yet?</quote> Doing homework is an activity
that has a beginning, a middle, and an end. So when we pinpoint the time at
which doing homework happens, we are also pinpointing its beginning, its
middle, and its end. Which means that the first of those questions asks whether the
time is before the <emphasis>beginning</emphasis> of doing the homework, or
after it. The second question asks whether or not the time is in the
<emphasis>middle</emphasis> of doing the homework. And the third question
asks whether the time is after the <emphasis>end</emphasis> of doing
the homework, or not.</para>

<para>The term in linguistics for situating the beginnings and ends of
events is <firstterm>aspect</firstterm>. The term Lojban uses is
<firstterm>event contours</firstterm>: events are perceived as shapes,
which have beginnings and ends. (This is why Lojban can use its aspects in
space as well as time, although we won't be going into that here.) In many
languages, aspect is as important as tense, or even more important. In
Russian, to use the best-known example, you cannot use a verb at all
without choosing between a stem indicating that something is (or was, or
will be) still going on (<wordasword>imperfective</wordasword>), and a
stem indicating that something is (or was, or will be) completed 
(<wordasword>perfective</wordasword>). </para>

<para>English isn't like that: you can quite often leave off any 
indication of aspect in your verbs. Yet English has ways of expressing aspect 
anyway. When we say <quote>I have spoken to the doctor</quote>, we are also 
indicating that we have now finished doing so &mdash; we are after the end 
of the event. When we say <quote>I am speaking to the doctor</quote>, on 
the other hand, we are also indicating that we are in middle 
of the event: the event is continuing, and is not yet over.</para>

<note><para>Aspect is quite independent of tense: you can say that
something will be over some time in the future (<quote>I will have spoken
to the doctor [by then]</quote>), or that something was continuing in the
past (<quote>I was speaking to the doctor</quote>), without giving any
indication of what is happening in the here-and-now.</para></note>

<para>Lojban uses <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase>
belonging to <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase> ZAhO
to express event contours. You use them just like tense words; if you use
both, the tense word goes first. The three-way distinction we made &mdash;
before the beginning, in the middle, after the end &mdash; is made with
three distinct words: <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">pu'o, ca'o,
ba'o</foreignphrase>. This is, of course, no coincidence:
<emphasis>before</emphasis> (<foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">pu</foreignphrase>) an event begins, you use
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">pu'o</foreignphrase>; <emphasis>after</emphasis>
(<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ba</foreignphrase>) an event ends, you
use <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ba'o</foreignphrase>. So you can come 
up with sentences like these:

<informalexample>
<literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi ba'o tavla le mikce</foreignphrase>
I have spoken to the doctor (or had spoken, or will have spoken)</literallayout>
</informalexample><informalexample>

<sect1 id="less12moreasp"><title>More Aspects</title>

<para>The aspects <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">pu'o</foreignphrase> and
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ba'o</foreignphrase> describe situations 
in which the event is still not going on, or is no longer going on: if you 
draw a time-line, they are outside of the line corresponding to the event. 
But beginnings and endings are pretty conspicuous, as moments go. So we 
often want to point out that we are not before the beginning of the event, 
but right at the point when it begins; and not after the end of the event, but 
right at 
the point when it ends.
</para>

<para>To pinpoint your time at the instant when the event begins, the aspect
word you use is <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">co'a</foreignphrase>. So
you can say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi co'a tcidu le
cukta</foreignphrase> at the moment when you start reading a book. When you
stop reading the book, the aspect is <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">co'u</foreignphrase>. When you finish reading, on the
other hand, the word to use is <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mo'u</foreignphrase>. So Lojban makes a distinction
between finishing and stopping (before the event would have finished
normally).</para>

<para>For this kind of aspect, English normally just uses verbs: 
<wordasword>start</wordasword>, <wordasword>finish</wordasword>, 
<wordasword>stop</wordasword>. Lojban likewise allows you to use distinct <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> to express these notions: <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">cfari</foreignphrase>, <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">mulno</foreignphrase>, and <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">sisti</foreignphrase>. Using aspects just lets you 
express things more succinctly; and with Lojban the way it is, anything 
that makes things more succinct comes in handy.</para>

<para>There are more aspects in Lojban, though you won't necessarily see 
them as often in Lojban text; you can find out about them in Chapter 10 of 
<citetitle>The Complete Lojban Language</citetitle>.

<sect1 id="less12voc"><title>Vocatives</title>

<para>When you address people by name, you usually do so to make it clear
whom out of a group you are talking to. We've already seen how to do that
in Lojban: <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">doi</foreignphrase>, followed
by the name (without the name article, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">la</foreignphrase>.) So <quote>Houston, we have a
problem</quote> ends up as 

<informalexample><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">doi xustyn. mi'a
se nabmi </foreignphrase></para></informalexample>(sidestepping the slight illogicality of speaking
to a single person in Houston but addressing a whole city.)</para>

<para>Often, however, we address people in order to manage our 
conversations: to make someone pay attention to our turn; to butt in 
before it is our turn; to signal that a conversation is beginning or ending; 
and so on. We can also do this without using names, but instead by various 
context cues and all-purpose words. When you think about it, for example, 
<wordasword>OK</wordasword> does a lot of work for such a small word.</para>

<para>As we know, Lojban tends to be precise rather than vague. So when it 
comes to signalling what you want done with a conversation, Lojban doesn't 
play along with the usual natural language tricks of leaving it up to 
politeness and social convention to work out what's going on. Instead, it 
has explicit words for managing turns in a conversation, which can optionally be followed 
by the name of whoever you're bringing it to the attention of. Since all 
these words address someone, they are called 
<firstterm>vocatives</firstterm> (<foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase> COI.)</para>

<para>Natural languages don't distinguish as carefully between these 
various contexts, except in fairly artificial contexts: for example, 
conversations over two-way radio, where it is impossible to talk over each 
other, or to negotiate whose turn it is to speak through subtle visual 
cues. (A less elaborate vocabulary is in place for IRC, its Internet 
equivalent.) 
This means that Lojban vocatives look a little like a CB enthusiast's nightmare, 
because the glosses you see for them come from this more 
explicit subset of English. But normal English has these kinds of words as 
well &mdash; they're just not as clearly distinguished, because context is 
usually relied on instead.</para>

<para>We've slipped some of these past you already, too.

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mi'e</foreignphrase> is the word you use to introduce
yourself: it's the only vocative followed by the speaker's name, rather
than the addressee's. So <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi'e
.robin.</foreignphrase> means <quote>I'm Robin</quote> or <quote>This is
Robin speaking.</quote></para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">coi</foreignphrase> is the greeting word: it corresponds
to <quote>Hello</quote>, <quote>Good morning</quote>, <quote>Hi</quote>,
<quote>Wazzup?</quote>, and whatever else happens to be in vogue.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Conversely, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">co'o</foreignphrase> is the farewell word, corresponding
to <quote>Goodbye</quote>, <quote>Farewell</quote>, <quote>Yo Later
Dude</quote>, and so on. Lojbanists signing off on e-mail often end with
something like <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">co'omi'e
.robin.</foreignphrase> &mdash; this is equivalent to putting your name at
the end of your email in English as a signature, and translates as
<quote>Goodbye; I'm Robin.</quote></para></listitem>

</itemizedlist></para>

<para>The other vocatives are not as common.

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Two words similar to
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">coi</foreignphrase> are <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ju'i</foreignphrase> <quote role="gloss">Hey!</quote>,
with which you draw someone's attention, and <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fi'i</foreignphrase> <quote
role="gloss">Welcome!</quote>, with which you offer hospitality. (It's what
you say to a visitor; you wouldn't say it over the phone, for instance,
unless your addressee is calling from the airport and is on their way over.)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">je'e</foreignphrase> corresponds to
<quote role="gloss">Roger!</quote> in radio-speak, and <quote
role="gloss">right</quote> or <quote role="gloss">uh-uh</quote> in normal
English: it confirms that you've received a message. If you haven't, you
say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">je'enai</foreignphrase> instead (of
course); in normal English, that would be <quote role="gloss">Beg your
pardon?</quote> or <quote role="gloss">Huh?</quote>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>In case you haven't received the message clearly, you can
explicitly ask for the speaker to repeat whatever they said with
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ke'o</foreignphrase>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Similarly, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">be'e</foreignphrase>
signals a request to send a message (<quote>Hello? Are you there?</quote>),
and <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">re'i</foreignphrase> indicates that
you are <emphasis>ready</emphasis> 
(Lojban <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">bredi</foreignphrase>) to receive a message.
(It's what you say when you pick up the phone &mdash; which in English also happens to be <quote>Hello?</quote>,
but in Italian is <foreignphrase lang="ita">Pronto</foreignphrase> <quote
role="gloss">Ready!</quote>.)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mu'o</foreignphrase> is what you say when you explicitly
make it another speaker's turn to speak: it's the <quote>Over!</quote> of
radio.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>When it isn't your turn to speak, but you want to barge in anyway,
you can say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ta'a</foreignphrase> &mdash;
though it probably won't make anyone any happier that you're interrupting.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">nu'e</foreignphrase> introduces a
promise; <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">pe'u</foreignphrase> introduces a
request, and so is fairly similar to the attitudinal <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.e'o</foreignphrase>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">vi'o</foreignphrase> acknowledges a request, and promises
to carry it out: in radio talk this is <quote>Wilco!</quote>, and in normal
English <quote>OK</quote> or <quote>All right, I will</quote> (or for that
matter, <quote>Consider it done!</quote>)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>You say <quote>Thank you</quote>
with <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ki'e</foreignphrase> &mdash; to which
the appropriate response is <emphasis>not</emphasis> <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fi'i</foreignphrase> (<quote>You're welcome</quote>
doesn't mean you're being visited by some guests), but the simple
acknowledgement <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">je'e</foreignphrase>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Finally, to close communication (radio's <quote>Over and
out!</quote>), you can use <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fe'o</foreignphrase>. (This is what people actually
<emphasis>should</emphasis> be putting at the end of their e-mails; but
it's not as well-known a word as <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">co'o</foreignphrase>)</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist></para>

<para>Vocatives take names, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> or <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>. The names come after an obligatory pause, 
to make sure any eavesdropping computers don't misconstrue the vocative as one long name.
The <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> or <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> describing the addressee (e.g. <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">co'o la mensi</foreignphrase> or <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">co'o mensi</foreignphrase>
<quote>Goodbye, sister!</quote>); so they normally
don't need terminators. If you use the vocative on its own, however, you
will need a terminator, because the things likeliest to follow the vocative 
in a sentence could easily be misconstrued as describing your addressee. The terminator for
vocatives is <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">do'u</foreignphrase>. For example,

<informalexample><literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">coi do'u la suzyn. la ranjit. puzi cliva</foreignphrase>
Hello! Susan's just left Ranjeet.</literallayout>

</informalexample><informalexample><literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">coi la suzyn. la ranjit. puzi cliva</foreignphrase>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="less12fuhivla"><title>Loan words</title>

<para>You got a brief taste of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">lujvo</foreignphrase> in <link linkend="less8">Lesson
8</link>. As we said there, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">lujvo</foreignphrase> are the main way of introducing new
words &mdash; more precisely, new <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">brivla</foreignphrase> &mdash; into Lojban. The most
important thing about <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">lujvo</foreignphrase> is that, as <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>, they are meant to have very
well-defined place structures; and there are suggestions in place for
deriving them (see <citetitle>The Complete Lojban Language</citetitle>,
Chapter 12.) So, particularly when the concept you want to express is
<quote role="socalled">verb-like</quote> (that is, when it's likely to have
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> of its own),
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lujvo</foreignphrase> are
preferred.</para>

<para>There are some cases, though, when you do have to borrow a word from
another language. This can be because the thing you're talking about is
very concrete or particular, and/or because the reference is quite
culture-specific. In either case, it would be really cumbersome to describe
it with a combination of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase>. (For example, how would you come
up with a description for <wordasword>brie</wordasword>? Or
<wordasword>rock 'n' roll</wordasword>? &mdash; which, we should point out,
you would have to keep distinct from the later musical genre of <wordasword>rock</wordasword>!)</para>

<para>The problem with borrowing words into Lojban is, Lojban has a quite 
thorough set-up for working out what the words are in a stream of letters. 
This means that most words you import into Lojban (once you spell them in 
Lojban letters) are likely to mean something else already. For 
example, if I want to bring the word <wordasword>Esperanto</wordasword> into 
Lojban, the last thing I want to do is start saying <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.esperanto</foreignphrase>. That will get analysed as <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.e speranto</foreignphrase>, which is something like 
<quote role="gloss">and marriage-soft</quote>.</para>

<note><para>Well, it would be if <quote 
role="gloss">soft</quote> was <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ranto</foreignphrase> instead of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ranti</foreignphrase> &mdash; but the point should still 
be clear: importing words as they are would lead to confusion and havoc.</para></note>

<para>The sanctioned way to deal with loan-words (described in more detail
in <citetitle>The Complete Lojban Language</citetitle>, Chapter 4.7) is to stick a
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> (minus its final
letter) in front of the word, showing what sort of thing the word
is; and to put an <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">r</foreignphrase> (or,
if an <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">r</foreignphrase> is already there,
an <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">n</foreignphrase>) between the
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> and the word. The
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> helps the
reader or listener, who has likely never seen this word before,
guess what the word might be. (This is particularly handy if the source
word might be ambiguous between two different meanings.) And the
combination of <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> minus
final vowel, source word (which should start with a consonant, and end with
a vowel), and <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">r</foreignphrase> or
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">n</foreignphrase> will hopefully produce a
cluster of consonants crunchy enough that it cannot be mistaken for another
Lojban word or phrase.)</para>

<tip><para>There is no standard consonant to put in front of the word to become a
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">fu'ivla</foreignphrase> if it starts with a vowel.
Two popular choices are <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">x</foreignphrase> and
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">n</foreignphrase>. Similarly, there is no set convention
on where to get the vowel from if your word ends in a consonant. In these lessons,
we'll just repeat the preceding vowel; e.g. <wordasword>England</wordasword> &rArr;
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gugdr<emphasis>n</emphasis>ingland<emphasis>a</emphasis></foreignphrase>
(from <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gugde</foreignphrase> <quote role="gloss">country</quote>.)</para></tip>

<para>So what does all this look like in practice? Well, we've already seen
<wordasword>curry</wordasword>:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>take <quote role="gloss">food</quote>,
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cidj[a]</foreignphrase>;</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>take the word in 
Lojban garb (starting with a consonant and ending with a vowel), <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">kari</foreignphrase>;</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>and wedge them together with an <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">r</foreignphrase>: <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">cidjrkari</foreignphrase>. </para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>(The consonant cluster is also crunchy enough to be difficult to 
pronounce; the <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">r</foreignphrase> is a 
syllable on its own, and the word should sound something like 
<wordasword>shidgerrrrrkari</wordasword>.)</para>

<para>Loan words (in Lojban, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fu'ivla</foreignphrase>) are still only sporadically
used &mdash; particularly because, as of this writing at least, there is no Lojban
dictionary where a standard list of them can be looked up. The problem of
which language to borrow words from is also hard to settle, and the choices
made can cause problems of their own. The most international solution for
plant and animal names, for example, is Latin, and in particular the Latin
of the Linnaean system of classification. But this means that, to come up
with a word for <quote role="gloss">catnip</quote>, say, you have to know
Latin and your Linnaean taxonomy (Or, like I did, look it up on the
Internet &mdash; but you can't normally do that while you're having a
conversation.) So <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">fu'ivla</foreignphrase>
are still largely unexplored terrain in Lojban.</para>

<note><para>That said, you will occasionally see <quote
role="socalled">Stage 4</quote> <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fu'ivla</foreignphrase> in use. The <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fu'ivla</foreignphrase> we've seen are <quote
role="socalled">Stage 3</quote>; in Stage 4, you drop the initial <quote
role="socalled">crunchy</quote> <foreignphrase

<sect1 id="less12eq"><title>Equalities</title>

<para>You may at some stage have asked yourself the question, what the
Lojban for <wordasword>is</wordasword> is. The short answer is, most of the
time there isn't one. Lojban represents the world in terms of relations
(<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase>), and
<wordasword>is</wordasword> is a fairly empty kind of relation. Moreover,
if the thing to the right of <wordasword>is</wordasword> (the <quote
role="socalled">predicate</quote>, in grammar terminology) means a class of
things, instead of a single entity, then it corresponds to a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>, and we don't need to put a word
for <wordasword>is</wordasword> in. So <quote>Robin 
<emphasis>is</emphasis> English</quote> comes out in Lojban as <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">la robin. glico</foreignphrase>: <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">glico</foreignphrase> is already a <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> that takes <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">la robin.</foreignphrase> as a <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> &mdash; so we don't need a separate 
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> for 
<wordasword>is</wordasword>.
</para>

<para>Very, very, <emphasis>very</emphasis> occasionally, you'll need a 
Lojban word for <wordasword>is</wordasword> anyway. Lojban offers three 
words which sort of do the job of <wordasword>is</wordasword>; each has its 
own provisos.
</para>

<para>The first word is <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">me</foreignphrase>.
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">me</foreignphrase> takes a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> following it, and converts it into
a <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>. So
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">me la nik.</foreignphrase> is a
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>, which takes as a
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> anything that <quote
role="socalled">is a Nick</quote>. Similarly, since <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">le mi ci mensi</foreignphrase> is <quote role="gloss">my
three sisters</quote>, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la renas. me le mi
ci mensi</foreignphrase> means <quote>Rena is one of my three
sisters</quote> (as she is described by the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> version of <quote role="gloss">my three
sisters</quote>.) So <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">me</foreignphrase> is 
best thought of as meaning <quote role="gloss">is one of</quote>.</para>

<tip><title>Historical note</title><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">me</foreignphrase>,
way back in the dawn of (Lojbanic) time, used to mean <quote role="gloss">pertaining
to</quote> instead of <quote role="gloss">is</quote>. You'll see confusion between the
two persisting among old timers. Be gentle with them, we pray you...</para></tip>

<para>The second word is <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">du</foreignphrase>. <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">du</foreignphrase> is a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> on its own, and it means that all
its <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> are the same
thing and have the same identity. So <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi du
la nik.</foreignphrase> (or <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi du la
robin.</foreignphrase>) is a way of saying <quote>I am Robin (or
Nick.)</quote> The claim made is one of identity; so you can flip the
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> around without
making any difference: <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la robin. du
mi</foreignphrase>. It does <emphasis>not</emphasis> make a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> behave like a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>, so <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">du</foreignphrase> cannot mean <quote role="gloss">is one
of</quote>, like <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">me</foreignphrase> does:
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la renas. du le mi ci
mensi</foreignphrase> makes the nonsensical claim that Rena
<emphasis>is</emphasis> my three sisters. (Or should that be
<wordasword>are</wordasword>?)</para>

<tip><para>Can you say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi du lo
prenu</foreignphrase>, doing the Lojban equivalent of making an indefinite
noun <quote role="socalled">equal</quote> a definite noun? After all,
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">lo prenu</foreignphrase> applies to many
more people in the world than just me, so <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">du</foreignphrase> here does kind of acts like <quote
role="gloss">is one of</quote>. The answer is, yes you can, because in this
context they both do refer to the same person. (In strict logical terms:
there is at least one person such that that person is me.) This is frowned
upon in Lojban in general, though, because it's misleading: <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">du</foreignphrase> tends to be reserved for mathematical
equality, and for claiming that two different names (or definite nouns)
refer to the same thing. If you really wanted to say <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mi du lo prenu</foreignphrase>, after all, why wouldn't you
just say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi
prenu</foreignphrase>?</para></tip>

<para>These two means are grammatical Lojban, but they are viewed with some
distaste, and are usually giveaways that some poor translating from English
(or another natural language) has been going on. The third mechanism is
better regarded, because it tucks the equality away in an 
inconspicuous corner.
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">po'u</foreignphrase> has the same grammar
as the <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> modifiers
like <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">pe</foreignphrase> and <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">po</foreignphrase> we saw in <link linkend="less3">Lesson
3.</link> But instead of claiming that one <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> is associated with the other, or
owned by the other, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">po'u</foreignphrase>
claims that the two <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>
are the same thing. So:

<informalexample><literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la ranjit. <emphasis>po'u</emphasis> le pendo be la djiotis. vi zvati</foreignphrase>
Ranjeet, <emphasis>who is</emphasis> Jyoti's friend, is here.</literallayout> 

</informalexample>Like those other members of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase> GOI (<foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">pe</foreignphrase>, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">po</foreignphrase> and <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">po'e</foreignphrase>), <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">po'u</foreignphrase> has a non-restrictive version:
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">no'u</foreignphrase>. So if I was saying
that Ranjeet was Jyoti's friend, not to distinguish him from the other
Ranjeets you might know, but just for your information, I should use
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">no'u</foreignphrase> instead of
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">po'u</foreignphrase>.</para>

<note><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">no'u</foreignphrase> and
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">po'u</foreignphrase> are typically used in
Lojban to introduce alternate names for something; so they correspond to
English <wordasword>namely, i.e.</wordasword> For instance, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">la suzyn. penmi la xukske fanza ku <emphasis>no'u</emphasis>
la jan.</foreignphrase> <quote>Susan met <quote role="socalled">Chemistry
Annoyance</quote>, <emphasis>namely</emphasis> Zhang.</quote></para></note>

spelling.)</para></listitem>

borrowing the word from English; <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">bilmrpsikopati</foreignphrase> or
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">bilmrpsikopatia</foreignphrase>, if you want something closer to
Greek (and thus presumably more recongisable.)</para></listitem>

<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cidrndeuterio</foreignphrase>, if you know about those ablatives
I'm not going to explain here...)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">jemnrxametisti</foreignphrase>: you can't use
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">n</foreignphrase> as your favourite joining consonant, because
the <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> prefix already ends in <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">n</foreignphrase>!
(As it turns out, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">jemnrametisti</foreignphrase> would have
also been acceptable as a <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">fu'ivla</foreignphrase>.)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">le vi blanu karce poi du le pritu be le mi karce cu me

ways, to narrow it down. But the brand of a car is a class, so the second 
<wordasword>is</wordasword> is not an equality sign.)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">le vi blanu karce po'u le pritu be le mi karce cu me

need a restrictive rather than a non-restrictive clause.)<note>
<para>This use of <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">me</foreignphrase> is pretty
standard to get a <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cmene</foreignphrase>
into a <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">tanru</foreignphrase>. There are 
often times when you will want to use a name to describe a class of 
things, rather than a unique thing, which in turn means you have to treat a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cmene</foreignphrase> like a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>, entering into domains like <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">tanru</foreignphrase>. In fact, as
an extension of this, Type 1 and 2 <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fu'ivla</foreignphrase> are merely <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cmene</foreignphrase> converted with <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">me</foreignphrase> to <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>: Type 1 involves the undigested
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cmene</foreignphrase>, with <foreignphrase

lang="art-lojban">me la'o gy.</foreignphrase> <foreignphrase lang="eng">curry</foreignphrase> <foreignphrase

<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la</foreignphrase> (e.g. <foreignphrase

<listitem><para>After they have finished eating, the three friends are now 
discussing. (Aspects can be used as <foreignphrase

<emphasis>finished</emphasis> eating when they started talking again.)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>While they were doing so, they went to the disco [which is] <citetitle>The 
Funky Chicken</citetitle> (Aspects can also be used to connect sentences, 
just like tenses can. <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.i ca'o bo</foreignphrase> means that the second sentence 
took place while the first sentence was still going on. The <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fu'ivla</foreignphrase> considers 
<wordasword>Funky</wordasword> to be a kind of music: <quote

<listitem><para>Ranjeet says <quote>Heheh, thanks! I now start hearing 
myself!</quote> (This is a more pedantic rendering of what in English 
would be more like <quote>I can hear 
myself think again</quote>. The <foreignphrase

Ranjeet would be addressing himself: <quote>Thanks, Me!</quote>)</para></listitem>

his vocatives.)</para></listitem>

use; it's somewhat more controversial to think of love as something with a
natural ending point (<foreignphrase

has turned Susan off some perfectly acceptable beverages &mdash; had not
necessarily reached that point, anyway. If you wanted to keep the umlaut,
you could also use <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la'o dy. G&uuml;nter
dy.</foreignphrase>, or something like that. We presume this is the only
G&uuml;nter they know, so his nickname isn't being used to distinguish him
from other G&uuml;nters; hence, <foreignphrase

that. You can't avoid <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">do'u</foreignphrase>
